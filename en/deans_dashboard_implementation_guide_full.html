    <p>(Contextualization/Overview of using DHIS2 as Dean&#8217;s Dashboard - adapted from materials provided by CapPlus)</p>

    <p>
      The Dean&#8217;s Dashboard is most effective as part of a strategic planning process. Before a school can implement a dashboard, it needs access to high-quality, routinely collected, individual-level data. While data are usable in any easily accessed format, having data in a digital system is ideal, even in electronic spreadsheets. Pilot institutions found that setting up the dashboard&#8217;s data and reports was relatively easy once the DHIS 2 interface was mastered. After a representative of an institution has been trained to configure and utilize DHIS 2, few resources are required to continue and expand its usefulness. 
    </p>


    <p>
      Health workforce educational institutions around the globe are struggling to meet the increasing demand for health workers capable of providing quality health services to expanding populations. These institutions must find ways to produce more health workers within current, marginally expanding, or even decreasing budgets. More effective and efficient management of education and training institutions can play a major role in a country&#8217;s ability to scale up its production of competent and qualified health workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dean&#8217;s Dashboard is a computerized tool to guide a school&#8217;s management team in defining management goals and tracking progress toward goal achievement. The Dean&#8217;s Dashboard is meant to measure progress and chart trends, indicating either improvement over time or need for strategic action.

    <p>
    The primary use case of the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard is tool to monitor key school management performance areas by school leaders.  This should be achieved by supporting these main requirements:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><p>
	The design of indicators to track school performance areas

    <p>
      In terms of infrastructure needed, two options exist&#8212;in the cloud or local to the institution. Small institutions may prefer to pay for a cloud-based implementation (that is, to access and use the software entirely online) as purchasing and maintaining servers may be prohibitive. Institutions with strong ICT units may prefer to install the software locally in their data centers. Configuring and implementing the system is not overly complex, but support will be essential to new users.

    <p>
      Is Your Organization Ready for the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard?
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering these questions can help your institution understand its level of readiness to initiate the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard program. You may find it helpful to have a colleague review your responses or to answer the questions with a larger group (e.g., senior leaders).  Has your institution clearly defined the need to use the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard?

    </p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
	Have you clearly defined the need that is driving your institution to consider implementing the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard?
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	  An organization is more likely to be ready to undertake a Dean&#8217;s Dashboard initiative when it has objective information to support the need for improving specific areas.

	Who in your organization uses information to guide decision making and process improvement?
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	  Dean&#8217;s Dashboard is an information system that offers informational reports on a number of indicators important to your institution. Understanding than one individual or a team of persons using that information can affect how successful it can be for addressing your situation.

      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Is now the right time for implementing an information tool such as the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard (i.e., it will not compete with other major changes currently being made at your institution)?
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	  If your organization is currently experiencing many changes, it may not be the ideal moment to begin implementing the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard initiative. Attempting to manage multiple change efforts at one time may degrade your institution's ability and employees' willingness to implement and sustain the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard effort. The program may be viewed as a distraction rather than a solution.
	</p></blockquote></div><p>
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Will your institution's leaders support the effort required to implement and sustain the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard initiative?
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	  It is essential that the leaders of your institution actively support and champion Dean&#8217;s Dashboard. Leaders needs to understand the requirements of the program (e.g., identification of indicators in an iterative process spanning several weeks, technical preparation and training of system users, regular meetings to reinforce concepts and skills) and be willing to provide the personnel, time, and resources required to successfully implement and sustain the program. 
	</p></blockquote></div><p>

      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Will your institution allow time for personnel to attend training?
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	  While the Dean&#8217;s Dashboard will be designed by participating institutions, some direct staff training will be required. The full training element of the program includes up to XX hours of classroom learning; however, your institution may decide to train only one segment (e.g., a specific indicator or set of related indicators) that may require 1 hour. To preclude disruptions and scheduling problems and to maximize learning, participants should be excused from all duties while attending class.

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="mod1_1"></a>7.1.&nbsp;DHIS 2 Background</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>DHIS 2 is a tool for collection, validation, analysis, and presentation of aggregate statistical data, tailored (but not limited) to integrated health information management activities. It is a generic tool rather than a pre-configured database application, with an open meta-data model and a flexible user interface that allows the user to design the contents of a specific information system without the need for programming. DHIS2 and upwards is a modular web-based software package built with free and open source Java frameworks.</p>
    <p>DHIS2 is open source software released under the BSD license and can be used at no cost. It runs on any platform with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE 6 or higher) installed. </p>
    <p>DHIS 2 is developed by the Health Information Systems Programme (HISP) as an open and globally distributed process with developers currently in India, Vietnam, Tanzania, Ireland, and Norway. The development is coordinated by the University of Oslo with core support from NORAD. </p>
    <p>As of October 2012, the DHIS 2 software is used in more than 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and countries that have adopted DHIS 2 as their nation-wide HIS software include Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Liberia, and Bangladesh. A rapidly increasing number of countries and organisations are starting up new deployments.</p>
    <p>The documentation provided herewith, will attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the application. Given the abstract nature of the application, this manual will not serve as a complete step-by-step guide of how to use the application in each and every circumstance, but rather will seek to provide illustrations and examples of how DHIS2 can be implemented in a variety of situations through generalized examples.</p>
    <p>Before implementing DHIS 2 in a new setting, we highly recommend reading the DHIS 2 Implementation Guide (a separate manual from this one), also available at the main DHIS2 <a class="ulink" href="http://dhis2.org/documentation/" target="_top">website</a>.</p>

    <p>The key features and purpose of DHIS 2 can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Provide a comprehensive HIS solution based on data
          warehousing principles and a modular structure which can easily be
          customised to the different needs of the health systems - and supports the idea of an integrated HIS at all levels of the health hierarchy.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Customisation and local adaptation through the user interface. No programming required to start using DHIS 2 in a new setting (country, region, district etc.).</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Provide data entry tools which can either be in the form
          of standard  lists or tables, or can be

        <p>Provide different kinds of tools for data validation and
          improvement of data quality.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Provide easy to use - one-click reports with charts and tables for selected indicators or summary reports using the design of the  data collection tools. Integration with popular external report design tools like iReport and BIRT allows super-users to flexibly add more custom reports accessible to all users.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Flexible and dynamic (on-the-fly) data analysis in the Data Visualizer and the GIS modules.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">

      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Easy to use user-interfaces for metadata management e.g. for adding/editing datasets or health facilities. No programming needed to set up the system in a new setting.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Functionality to design and modify calculated indicator formulas.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">

        <p>Messages can be sent to system users for feedback and notifications. Messages can also be delivered to email and SMS.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Users can share and discuss their data in charts and  reports using Interpretations, enabling an active information-driven user community.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Functionalities of export-import of data and metadata, supporting synchronisation of offline installations as well as interoperability with other applications.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Integration with other software systems &#8211; using the DHIS 2 Web-API and the  Integration Engine.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Further modules can be
          developed  and integrated as per user needs, either as part of the DHIS 2 portal user interface or a  more loosely-coupled external application  interacting through the DHIS 2 Web-API.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>In summary, DHIS2 provides a comprehensive HIS solution for the
      reporting and analysis needs of health information users at any level.</p>

    <p>The wider context of HIS can be comprehensively described through
      the information cycle presented in Figure 1.1 below. The information
      cycle pictorially depicts the different components, stages and processes
      through which the data is collected, checked for quality, processed,
      analysed and used.</p>

  </p>
    <p>As a first step, DHIS 2 serves as a data collection, recording and
      compilation tool, and all data (be it in numbers or text form) can be
      entered into it. Data entry can be done in lists of data elements or in
      customised user defined forms which can be developed to mimic paper based forms in order to ease the process of data entry.</p>
    <p>As a next step, DHIS 2 can be used to increase data quality.
      First, at the point of data entry, a check can be made to see if data
      falls within acceptable range levels of minimum and maximum values for
      any particular data element. Such checking, for example, can help to
      identify typing errors at the time of data entry. Further, user can
      define various validation rules, and DHIS 2 can run the data through the
      validation rules to identify violations. These types of checks help to ensure that data entered into the system is of good quality from the start, and can be improved by the people who are most familiar with it. </p>
    <p>When data has been entered and verified, DHIS 2 can help to make
      different kinds of reports. The first kind are the routine reports that
      can be predefined, so that all those reports that need to be routine
      generated can be done on a click of a button. Further, DHIS 2 can help
      in the generation of analytical reports through comparisons of for
      example indicators across facilities or over time. Graphs, maps, reports
      and health profiles are among the outputs that DHIS 2 can produce, and
      these should routinely be produced, analysed, and acted upon by health
      managers.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e298"></a>7.4.1.&nbsp;DHIS as a platform</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>DHIS can be perceived as a platform on several levels. First, the application database is designed ground-up with flexibility in mind. Data structures such as data elements, organisation units, forms and user roles can be defined completely freely through the application user interface. This makes it possible for the system to be adapted to a multitude of locale contexts and use-cases. We have seen that DHIS supports most major requirements for routine data capture and analysis emerging in country implementations. It also makes it possible for DHIS to serve as management system for domains such as logistics, labs and finance.</p>
      <p>Second, due to the modular design of DHIS it can be extended with additional software modules. These software modules can live side by side with the core modules of DHIS and can be integrated into the DHIS portal and menu system. This is a powerful feature as it makes it possible to extend the system with extra functionality when needed, typically for country specific requirements as earlier pointed out.</p>
      <p>The downside of the software module extensibility is that it puts several constraints on the development process. The developers creating the extra functionality are limited to the DHIS technology in terms of programming language and software frameworks, in addition to the constraints put on the design of modules by the DHIS portal solution. Also, these modules must be included in the DHIS software when the software is built and deployed on the web server, not dynamically during run-time. </p>
      <p>In order to overcome these limitations and achieve a looser coupling between the DHIS service layer and additional software artifacts, the DHIS development team decided to create a Web API. This Web API complies with the rules of the REST architectural style. This implies that:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>The Web API provides a navigable and machine-readable interface to the complete DHIS data model. For instance, one can access the full list of data elements, then navigate using the provided hyperlink to a particular data element of interest, then navigate using the provided hyperlink to the list of forms which this data element is part of. E.g. clients will only do state transitions using the hyperlinks which are dynamically embedded in the responses.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Data is accessed through a uniform interface (URLs) using a well-known protocol. There are no fancy transport formats or protocols involved - just the well-tested, well-understood HTTP protocol which is the main building block of the Web today. This implies that third-party developers can develop software using the DHIS data model and data without knowing the DHIS specific technology or complying with the DHIS design constraints. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>All data including meta-data, reports, maps and charts, known as resources in REST terminology, can be retrieved in most of the popular representation formats of the Web of today, such as HTML, XML, JSON, PDF and PNG. These formats are widely supported in applications and programming languages and gives third-party developers a wide range of implementation options.</p>

      <p>All computers have an Operating System (OS) to manage it and the
        programs running it. The operating system serves as the middle layer between the
        software application, such as DHIS 2, and the hardware, such as the
        CPU and RAM.    DHIS 2 runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and can therefore run on any operating system which supports Java. Platform
        independence implies that the software application can run on ANY OS -
        Windows, Linux, Macintosh etc. DHIS 2 is platform independent, and is
        extremely useful in the context of public health, where multiple operating systems may be in use.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, DHIS 2 is also platform independent when it comes to the Database Management System  (DBMS). DHIS 2 uses the Hibernate database abstraction framework and is compatible with any DBMS supported by Hibernate, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2, MS SQL Server, Oracle and many more. PostgreSQL is the recommended DBMS for DHIS 2.</p>
      <p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, since DHIS2 is a browser-based application, the
        only real requirement to interact with the system is with a web browser. DHIS2 supports most
        web browsers, although currently either Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera are
        recommended.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e317"></a>7.4.3.&nbsp;Deployment strategies - online vs offline</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>DHIS 2 is a network enabled application and can be accessed over the Internet, a local intranet and as a locally installed system. The deployment alternatives for DHIS 2 are in this chapter defined as i) offline deployment ii) online deployment and iii) hybrid deployment. The meaning and differences will be discussed in the following sections.</p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e320"></a>7.4.3.1.&nbsp;Offline Deployment</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>An offline deployment implies that multiple standalone offline instances are installed for end users, typically at the district level. The system is maintained primarily by the end users/district health officers who enters data and generate reports from the system running on their local server. The system will also typically be maintained by a national super-user team who pay regular visits to the district deployments. Data is moved upwards in the hierarchy by the end users producing data exchange files which are sent electronically by email or physically by mail or personal travel. (Note that the brief Internet connectivity required for sending emails does not qualify for being defined as online). This style of deployment has the obvious benefit that it works when appropriate Internet connectivity is not available. On the other side there are significant challenges with this style which are described in the following section.</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Hardware:</strong></span> Running stand-alone systems requires advanced hardware in terms of servers and reliable power supply to be installed, usually at district level,  all over the country. This requires appropriate funding for procurement and plan for long-term maintenance.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Software platform:</strong></span> Local installs implies a significant need for maintenance. From experience, the biggest challenge is viruses and other malware which tend to infect local installations in the long-run. The main reason is that end users utilize memory sticks for transporting data exchange files and documents between private computers, other workstations and the system running the application. Keeping anti-virus software and operating system patches up to date in an offline environment are challenging and bad practices in terms of security are often adopted by end users. The preferred way to overcome this issue is to run a dedicated server for the application where no memory sticks are allowed and use an Linux based operating system which is not as prone for virus infections as MS Windows.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Software application:</strong></span> Being able to distribute new functionality and bug-fixes to the health information software to users are essential for maintenance and improvement of the system. Relying on the end users to perform software upgrades requires extensive training and a high level of competence on their side as upgrading software applications might a technically challenging task. Relying on a national super-user team to maintain the software implies a lot of traveling.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Database maintenance: </strong></span>A prerequisite for an efficient system is that all users enter data with a standardized meta-data set (data elements, forms etc). As with the previous point about software upgrades, distribution of changes to the meta-data set to numerous offline installations requires end user competence if the updates are sent electronically or a well-organized super-user team. Failure to keep the meta-data set synchronized will lead to loss of ability to move data from the districts and/or an inconsistent national database since the data entered for instance at the district level will not be compatible with the data at the national level.</p>
          </li></ul></div>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e336"></a>7.4.3.2.&nbsp;Online deployment</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>An online deployment implies that a single instance of the application is set up on a server connected to the Internet. All users (clients) connect to the online central server over the Internet using a web browser. This style of deployment currently benefits from the  huge investments in and expansions of mobile networks in developing countries. This makes it possible to access online servers in even the most rural areas using mobile Internet modems  (also referred to as <span class="italic">dongles</span>).  </p>
        <p>This online deployment style has huge positive implications for the implementation process and application maintenance compared to the traditional offline standalone style:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Hardware:</strong></span> Hardware requirements on the end-user side are limited to a reasonably modern computer/laptop and Internet connectivity through a fixed line or a mobile modem. There is no need for a specialized server for each user, any Internet enabled computer will be sufficient. A server will be required for online deployments, but since there is only one (or several) servers which need to be procured and maintained, this is significantly simpler (and cheaper) than maintaining many separate servers is disparate locations.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Software platform:</strong></span> The end users only need a web browser to connect to the online server. All popular operating systems today are shipped with a web browser and there is no special requirement on what type or version. This means that if severe problems such as virus infections or software corruption occur one can always resort to re-formatting and installing the computer operating system or obtain a new computer/laptop. The user can continue with data entry where it was left and no data will be lost.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Software application:</strong></span> The central server deployment style means that the application can be upgraded and maintained in a centralized fashion. When new versions of the applications are released with new features and bug-fixes it can be deployed to the single online server. All changes will then be reflected on the client side the next time end users connect over the Internet. This obviously has a huge positive impact for the process of improving the system as new features can be distributed to users immediately, all users will be accessing the same application version, and bugs and issues can be sorted out and deployed on-the-fly.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Database maintenance: </strong></span>Similar to the previous point, changes to the meta-data can be done on the online server in a centralized fashion and will automatically propagate to all clients next time they connect to the server. This effectively removes the vast issues related to maintaining an upgraded and standardized meta-data set related to the traditional offline deployment style. It is extremely convenient for instance during the initial database development phase and during the annual database revision processes as end users will be accessing a consistent and standardized database even when changes occur frequently.</p>
          </li></ul></div>
        <p>This approach might be problematic in cases where Internet connectivity is volatile or
          missing in long periods of time. DHIS2 however has certain features which requires
          Internet connectivity to be available only part of the time for the system to work
          properly, such as offline data entry and the MyDatamart tool presented in a separate
          chapter in this guide, which cater to information flow in situations when Internet
          connectivity may be challenging.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e355"></a>7.4.3.3.&nbsp;Hybrid deployment</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>From the discussion so far one realizes that the online deployment style is favourable over the offline style but requires decent Internet connectivity where it will be used. It is important to notice that the mentioned styles can co-exist in a common deployment. It is perfectly feasible to have online as well as offline deployments within a single country. The general rule would be that districts and facilities should access the system online over the Internet where sufficient Internet connectivity exist, and offline systems should be deployed to districts where this is not the case. </p>
        <p>Defining decent Internet connectivity precisely is hard but as a rule of thumb the download speed should be minimum 10 Kbyte/second and accessibility should be minimum 70% of the time. </p>
        <p>In this regard mobile Internet modems which can be connected to a computer or laptop
          and access the mobile network is an extremely capable and feasible solution. Mobile
          Internet coverage is increasing rapidly all over the world, often provide excellent
          connectivity at low prices and is a great alternative to local networks and poorly
          maintained fixed Internet lines. Getting in contact with national mobile network companies
          regarding post-paid subscriptions and potential large-order benefits can be a wort-while
          effort. The network coverage for each network operator in the relevant country should be
          investigated when deciding which deployment approach to opt for as it might differ and
          cover different parts of the country.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e360"></a>7.4.3.4.&nbsp;Server hosting</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>The online deployment approach raises the question of where and how to host the server which will run the DHIS 2 application. Typically there are several options:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
            <p>Internal hosting within the Ministry of Health</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Hosting within a government data centre</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Hosting through an external hosting company</p>
          </li></ol></div>
        <p>The main reason for choosing the first option is often political motivation for having &#8220;physical ownership&#8221; of the database. This is perceived as important by many in order to &#8220;own&#8221; and control the data. There is also a wish to build local capacity for server administration related to sustainability of the project. This is often a donor-driven initiatives as it is perceived as a concrete and helpful mission.</p>
        <p>Regarding the second option, some places a government data centre is constructed with a view to promoting and improving the use and accessibility of public data. Another reason is that a proliferation of internal server environments is very resource demanding and it is more effective to establish centralized infrastructure and capacity.</p>
        <p>Regarding external hosting there is lately a move towards outsourcing the operation and administration of computer resources to an external provider, where those resources are accessed over the network, popularly referred to as &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; or &#8220;software as a service&#8221;. Those resources are typically accessed over the Internet using a web browser. </p>
        <p>The primary goal for an online server deployment is provide long-term stable and high-performance accessibility to the intended services. When deciding which option to choose for server environment there are many aspects to consider:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
            <p>Human capacity for server administration and operation. There must be human resources with general skills in server administration and in the specific technologies used for the application providing the services. Examples of such technologies are web servers and database management platforms.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Reliable solutions for automated backups, including local off-server and remote backup.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Stable connectivity and high network bandwidth for traffic to and from the server.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Stable power supply including a backup solution.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Secure environment for the physical server regarding issues such as access, theft and fire.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Presence of a disaster recovery plan. This plan must contain a realistic strategy for making sure that the service will be only suffering short down-times in the events of hardware failures, network downtime and more.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Feasible, powerful and robust hardware.</p>
          </li></ol></div>
        <p>All of these aspects must be covered in order to create an appropriate hosting environment. The hardware requirement is deliberately put last since there is a clear tendency to give it too much attention.</p>
        <p>Looking back at the three main hosting options, experience from implementation missions in developing countries suggests that all of the hosting aspects are rarely present in option one and two at a feasible level. Reaching an acceptable level in all these aspects is challenging in terms of both human resources and money, especially when compared to the cost of option three. It has the benefit that is accommodates the mentioned political aspects and building local capacity for server administration, on the other hand can this be provided for in alternative ways.</p>
        <p>Option three - external hosting - has the benefit that it supports all of the mentioned hosting aspects at a very affordable price. Several hosting providers - of virtual servers or software as a service - offer reliable services for running most kinds of applications. Example of such providers are <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linode.com" target="_top">Linode</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://aws.amazon.com" target="_top">Amazon Web Services</a>. Administration of such servers happens over a network connection, which most often anyway is the case with local server administration. The physical location of the server in this case becomes irrelevant as that such providers offer services in most parts of the world. This solution is increasingly becoming the standard solution for hosting of application services. The aspect of building local capacity for server administration is compatible with this option since a local ICT team can be tasked with maintaining the externally hosted server, but with not being burdened with worrying about power supply and bandwidth constraints which usually exist outside of major data centres.</p>
        <p>An approach for combining the benefits of external hosting with the need for local hosting and physical ownership is to use an external hosting provider for the primary transactional system, while mirroring this server to a locally hosted non-critical server which is used for read-only purposes such as data analysis and accessed over the intranet.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e395"></a>7.5.&nbsp;Difference between Aggregated and Patient data in a HIS</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Patient data</em></span> is data relating to a single patient, such as his/her
      diagnosis, name, age, earlier medical history etc. This data is typically based on a single
      patient-health care worker interaction. For instance, when a patient visits a health care
      clinic, a variety of details may be recorded, such as the patient's temperature, their
      weight, and various blood tests. Should this patient be diagnosed as having "Vitamin B 12
      deficiency anaemia, unspecified" corresponding to ICD-10 code D51.9, this particular
      interaction might eventually get recorded as an instance of "Anaemia" in an
      aggregate based system. Patient based data is important when you want to track longitudinally
      the progress of a patient over time. For example, if we want to track how a patient is
      adhering to and responding to the process of TB treatment (typically taking place over 6-9
      months), we would need patient based data.</p>
    <p>
   <span class="emphasis"><em>Aggregated data</em></span> is the consolidation of data
      relating to multiple patients, and therefore cannot be traced back to a
      specific patient. They are merely counts, such as incidences of Malaria,
      TB, or other diseases. Typically, the routine data that a health
      facility deals with is this kind of aggregated statistics, and is used
      for the generation of routine reports and indicators, and most importantly, strategic planning within the health system. Aggregate data cannot provide the type of detailed information which patient level data can, but is crucial for planning and guidance of the performance of health systems. </p>
    <p>In between the two you have case-based data, or anonymous "patient" data. A lot of details can be collected about a specific health event without necessarily having to identify the patient it involved. Inpatient or outpatient visits, a new case of cholera, a maternal death etc.  are common use-cases where one would like to collect a lot more detail that just adding to the total count of cases, or visits. This data is often collected in line-listing type of forms, or in more detailed audit forms. In is different from aggregate data in the sense that it contains many details about a specific event, whereas the aggregate data would count how many events of a certain type, e.g. how many outpatient visits with principal diagnosis "Malaria", or how many maternal deaths where the deceased did not attend ANC, or how many cholera outbreaks for children under 5 years. In DHIS 2 this data is collected through programs of the type single event without registration.</p>
    <p>Patient data is highly confidential and therefore must be
      protected so that no one other than doctors can get it. When in paper,
      it must be properly stored in a secure place. For computers, patient
      data needs secure systems with passwords, restrained access and audit logs.</p>
    <p>Security concerns for aggregated data are not as crucial as for
      patient data, as it is usually impossible  to identify a particular person to a aggregate statistic . However,
      data can still be misused and misinterpreted by others, and should not
      be distributed without adequate data dissemination policies in place. </p>

    <p>Software carries the instructions that tell a computer how to
        operate. The human authored and human readable form of those
        instructions is called source code. Before the computer can actually
        execute the instructions, the source code must be translated into a
        machine readable (binary) format, called the object code. All
        distributed software includes the object code, but <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> makes the
        source code available as well.</p>
    <p>Proprietary software owners license their copyrighted object
        code to a user, which allows the user to run the program. <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr>
        programs, on the other hand, license both the object and the source
        code, permitting the user to run, modify and possibly redistribute the
        programs. With access to the source code, the users have the freedom
        to run the program for any purpose, redistribute, probe, adapt, learn
        from, customise the software to suit their needs, and release
        improvements to the public for the good of the community. Hence, some
        <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> is also known as free software, where &#8220;free&#8221; refers, first and
        foremost, to the above freedoms rather than in the monetary sense of
        the word.</p>
    <p>Within the public health sector, <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> can potentially have a
        range of benefits, including:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Lower costs as it does not involve paying for prohibitive
            license costs.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Given the information needs for the health sector are
            constantly changing and evolving, there is a need for the user to
            have the freedom to make the changes as per the user requirements.
            This is often limited in proprietary systems.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Access to source code to enable integration and interoperability. In the health sector interoperability between different software applications is becoming increasingly important, meaning enabling two or more systems to communicate metadata and data.    This work is a lot easier, and sometimes dependent on the source code being available to the developers that create the integration. This availability is often not possible
            in the case of proprietary software. And when it is, it comes at a
            high cost and contractual obligations.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>FOSS applications like DHIS 2 typically are supported by a

      <p>You must be sure that you have a current version of the Java Runtime installed on your machine. Depending on your operating system, there are different ways of installing Java. The reader is referred to this <a class="ulink" href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" target="_top">website</a> for detailed information on getting Java installed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e442"></a>8.1.2.&nbsp;Starting the DHIS 2 Live package</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The DHIS 2 Live package is the easiest way to get started with DHIS2. DHIS2 Live is appropriate for a stand-alone  installation and demos.  Simply download the application from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dhis2.org/downloads" target="_top">here</a>. 
        Once the file is downloaded,  you can simply double-click the downloaded file, and get started using DHIS 2. </p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e446"></a>8.1.2.1.&nbsp;Starting up with a blank database</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>The live package comes with a demo database just like what you see on the <a class="ulink" href="http://apps.dhis2.org/demo/" target="_top">online demo</a> (which is based on the national Sierra Leone HMIS), and if you want to start with a blank system/database and build up your own system then you need to do the following:
</p>
        <p>1) Stop DHIS2 live if it is already running.  Right click on the tray icon  and select Exit.
The tray icon is  the green symbol on the bottom right of your screen (on Windows) which  should say' DHIS 2 Server  running' if you hold your mouse pointer over it.</p>
        <p>2) Open the folder where the DHIS 2 live package is installed  and locate the folder called "conf".
</p>
        <p>3) In conf/ open the file called 'hibernate.properties' in a text editor (notepad or similar) and do the following modification:
locate the string 'jdbc:h2:./database/dhis2' and replace the 'dhis2' part with any name that you want to give to your database (e.g. dhis2_test).</p>
        <p>4) Save and close the hibernate.properties file.
</p>
        <p>5) Start DHIS 2 Live by double-clicking on the file dhis2-live.exe in the DHIS 2 Live installation folder or by using a desktop shortcut or menu link that you might have set up.
</p>
        <p>6) Wait for the browser window to open and the login screen to show, and then log in with username: admin and password: district
</p>
        <p>7) Now you will see a completely empty DHIS 2 system and you should start by adding your users, organisational hierarchy, data elements, and datasets etc. Please refer to the other sections of the user manual for instructions on how to do this.
</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e457"></a>8.1.3.&nbsp;Working directly with the H2 database</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p> DHIS 2 Live uses an embedded <a class="ulink" href="www.h2database.com/" target="_top">H2</a> database. This
        has several advantages - there is no need to install a separate database engine such as
        PostgreSQL or MySQL, and backup can be made by just copying the file. The whole database
        exists in memory, which means high performance. The disadvantage is need for RAM. It is also
        not suitable for multi-user server installations. </p>
      <p>
      In general, it is recommended to work with the database through the DHIS2 user interface, but in some situations one may need to 
      manipulate the data directly. If one downloads H2 separately, it comes with a web interface. It can also be manipulated using 
        <a class="ulink" href="http://openoffice.org" target="_top">OpenOffice.org</a>, using the following procedure. This assumes that dhis2-live is located in
        the user's Linux home directory (represented by ~). Substitute the absolute path to your dhis2-live installation.

    <p>Regardless of whether you have installed the server version of the
    desktop Live version, you will use a web-browser to log on to the
    application. DHIS2 should be compatible with most modern web-browsers,
    although you will need to ensure that Java Script is enabled.</p>
    <p>To log on to the application just enter <a class="ulink" href="http://localhost:8080/dhis" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/dhis</a> if you
    are using the DHIS2 live package, or replace localhost with the name or IP
    address of the server where the server version is installed.</p>
    <p>Once you have started DHIS2, either on-line or off-line, the displayed
    screen will prompt you to enter your registered username and
password. After entering the required information click on log-in button
    to log into the application. The default user name and password are 'admin' and 'district'. They should be changed immediately upon logging on the first time.</p>
    <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="40%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/getting_started/login.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    <p>You can select the language which you wish to display DHIS2 in from the "Change language" dialog box at the bottom of the screen. Not all languages may be available. </p>
    <p>Should you have forgotten your password, you can click on the "Forgot password?" link. You must have informed DHIS2 of your email address and the server must be properly configured to send emails. </p>
    <p>If you want to create your own account (and the server administrator allows this), simply click "Create an account" and follow the directions provided. </p>
    <p>Once you have logged into DHIS2, refer to the specific sections in this manual for the different functionality which is available. </p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="database_design"></a>8.4.&nbsp;Quick intro to designing a DHIS 2 database</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The DHIS 2 application comes with a set of tools for data collection, validation, reporting and analysis, but the contents of the database, e.g. what to collect, who should collect it and on what format will depend on the context of use. This metadata need to be populated into the application before it can be used, and this can be done through the user interface and requires no programming or in-depth technical skills of the software. We call this initial process database design or customisation.</p>
    <p>This section will provide a very quick and brief introduction to DHIS 2 database design and mainly explain the various steps needed to prepare a new DHIS 2 system for use. How to do each step is explained in other chapters, and best practices on design choices will be explained in an implementers manual (expected during first half of 2011). Here are the steps to follow:</p>
    <p>1. Set up an organisational hierarchy</p>
    <p>2. Define data elements</p>
    <p>3. Define data sets and data entry forms</p>
    <p>4. Define validation rules</p>
    <p>5. Define indicators</p>
    <p>6. Define report tables and design reports</p>
    <p>7. Set up the GIS module</p>
    <p>8. Design charts and customise the dashboard</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e507"></a>8.4.1.&nbsp;The organisational hierarchy</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The organisational hierarchy defines the organisation using the DHIS 2, the health facilities, administrative areas and other geographical areas used in data collection and data analysis.  This dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit (e.g. Ministry of Health) and any number of levels and nodes below. Each node in this hierarchy is called an organisational unit in DHIS 2.</p>
      <p> The design of this hierarchy will determine the  geographical units of analysis available to the users  as data is collected and aggregated in this structure. There can only be one organisational hierarchy at the same time so its structure needs careful consideration. Additional  hierarchies (e.g. parallel administrative groupings such as "Facility ownership") can be modelled using organisational groups and group sets, however the organisational hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographical dimension. Typically national organisational hierarchies in public health have 4-6 levels, but any number of levels is supported. The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations, e.g. a Country or MoH unit (the root) might have e.g. 8 parent units (provinces), and each province again ( at  level 2) might have 10-15  districts as their children. Normally the health facilities will be located at the lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. national or provincial hospitals, so skewed organisational trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf nodes are at level 5). </p>
      <p>Typically there is a geographical hierarchy defined by the health system. e.g. where the administrative offices are located (e.g. MoH, province, district), but often there are other administrative boundaries in the country that might or might not be added, depending on how its boundaries will improve data analysis.   When designing the hierarchy the number of children for any organisational unit may indicate the usefulness of the structure, e.g. having one or more  1-1 relationships between two levels is not very useful as the values will be the same for the child and the parent level. On the other extreme a very high number of children in the middle of the hierarchy (e.g. 50 districts in a province) might call for an extra level to be added in between  to increase the usefulness of data analysis. The lowest level, the health facilities will often have a large number of children (10-60), but for other levels higher up in the hierarchy approx. 5-20 children is recommended. Too few or too many children might indicate that a level should be removed or added.</p>
      <p> Note that it is quite easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy at a later stage, the only problem is changing organisational units that collect data (the leaf nodes), e.g.  splitting or merging health facilities. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based on the current hierarchy at any time and will always reflect the most recent changes to the organisational structure. Refer to the chapter on Organisation Units to learn how to create organisational units and to build up the hierarchy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e513"></a>8.4.2.&nbsp;Data Elements</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The Data Element is perhaps the most important building block of a DHIS 2 database. It represents the "WHAT" dimension, it explains  what is being collected or analysed. In some contexts this is referred to an indicator, but in DHIS 2 we call this unit of collection and analysis a <span class="italic">data element</span>. The data element often represents a count of something,  and its name describes what is being counted, e.g. "BCG doses given" or "Malaria cases". When data is collected, validated, analysed, reported or presented it is the data elements or expressions built upon data elements that describes the WHAT of the data. As such the data elements become important for all aspects of the system and they decide not only how data is collected, but more importantly  how the data values are represented in the database, which again decides how data can be analysed and presented. </p>
      <p>It is possible to add more details to this "WHAT" dimension through the disaggregation dimension called data element categories. Some common categories are Age and Gender, but any category can be added by the user and linked to specific data elements. The combination of a data element's name and its assigned category defines the smallest unit of collection and analysis available in the system, and hence describes the raw data in the database. Aggregations can be done when zooming out of this dimension, but no further drill-down is possible, so designing data elements and categories define the detail of the analysis available to the system (on the WHAT dimension). Changes to data elements and categories at a later stage in the process might be complicated as these will change the meaning of the data values already captured in the database (if any). So this step is one of the more decisive and careful steps in the database design process.</p>
      <p>One best practice when designing data elements is to think of data elements as a unit of data analysis and not just as a field in the data collection form. Each data element lives on its own in the database, completely detached from the collection form, and reports and other outputs are based on data elements and expressions/formulas composed of data elements and not the data collection forms. So the data analysis needs should drive the process, and not the look an feel of the data collection forms. A simple rule of thumb is that the name of the data element must be able to stand on its own and describe the data value also outside the context of its collection form. E.g.  a data element name like "Total referrals" makes sense when looking at it in either the "RCH" form or the "OPD" form, but on its own it does not uniquely describe the phenomena (who are being referred?), and should in stead be called "Total referrals from Maternity" or "Total referrals from OPD". Two different data elements with different meanings, although the field on the paper form might only say "Total referrals" since the user of the form will always know where these referrals come from. In a database or a repository of data elements this context is no longer valid and therefore the names of the data elements become so important in describing the data.   </p>
      <p>Common properties of data elements can be modelled through what is called data element groups. The groups are completely flexible in the sense that they are defined by the user, both their names and their memberships. Groups are useful both for browsing and presenting related data, but can also be used to aggregate data elements together. Groups are loosely coupled to data elements and not tied directly to the data values which means they can be modified and added at any point in time without interfering with the raw data. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e520"></a>8.4.3.&nbsp;Datasets and data entry forms</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>All data entry in DHIS 2 is organised through the use of Datasets. A Dataset is a collection of data elements grouped together for data collection, and in the case of distributed installs they also define chunks of data for  export and import between instances of DHIS 2 (e.g. from a district office local installation to a national server). Datasets are not linked directly to the data values, only through their data elements and frequencies, and as such a dataset can be modified, deleted or added at any point in time without affecting the raw data already captured in the system, but such changes will of course affect how new data will be collected. </p>
      <p>A dataset  has a period type which controls the data collection frequency, which can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly. Both which data elements to include in the dataset and the period type is defined by the user, together with a name, short name, and code.</p>
      <p>In order to use a dataset to collect data for a specific orgunit you must assign the orgunit to the dataset, and this mechanism controls which orgunits that can use which datasets, and at the same time defines the target values for data completeness (e.g. how many health facilities in a district expected to submit RCH data  every month). </p>
      <p>A data element can belong to multiple datasets, but this requires careful thinking as it may lead to overlapping and inconstant data being collected if e.g. the datasets are given different frequencies and are used by the same orgunits.  
</p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e526"></a>8.4.3.1.&nbsp;Data entry forms</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>Once you have assigned a dataset to an orgunit that dataset will be made available in Data Entry (under Services) for the orgunits you have assigned it to and for the valid periods according to the dataset's period type. A default data entry form will then be shown, which is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the dataset together with a column for inputting the values. If your dataset contains data elements with categories such as age groups or gender, then additional columns will be automatically generated in the default form based on the categories. In addition to the default list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e529"></a>8.4.3.1.1.&nbsp;Section forms</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms
            and are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables
            with subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table
            (e.g. some categories do not apply to all data elements), both of these functions are
            supported in section forms. After defining a dataset you can define it's sections
            with subsets of dataelements, a heading and possible grey fields i the section's
            table. The order of sections in a dataset can also be defined. In Data Entry you can now
            start using the Section form (should appear automatically when sections are available
            for the selected dataset). You can switch between default and section forms in the top
            right corner of the data entry screen. Most tabular data entry forms should be possible
            to do with sections forms, and the more you can utilise the section forms (or default
            forms) the easier it is for you. If these two types of forms are not meeting your
            requirements then the third option is the completely flexible, although more
            time-consuming, custom data entry forms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d5e532"></a>8.4.3.1.2.&nbsp;Custom Forms</h5></div></div></div>
          
          <p>When the form you want to design is too complicated for the default or section forms then your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in term of the design. In DHIS 2 there is a  built in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the form designer and you can either design the form in the UI or paste in your html directly (using the Source window in the editor. In the custom form you can insert static text or data fields (linked to data elements + category) in any position on the form and you have complete freedom to design the layout of the form.   Once a custom form has been added to a dataset it will be available in data entry and used automatically. You can switch back to default and section (if exists) forms in the top right corner of the data entry screen. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e535"></a>8.4.4.&nbsp;Validation rules</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Once you have set up the data entry part of the system and started to collect data then
        there is time to define data quality checks that help to improve the quality of the data
        being collected. You can add as many validation rules as you like and these are composed of
        left and right side expressions that again are composed of data elements, with an operator
        between the two sides. Typical rules are comparing subtotals to totals of something. E.g. if
        you have two data elements "HIV tests taken" and "HIV test result
        positive" then you know that in the same form (for the same period and organisational
        unit) the total number of tests must always be equal or higher than the number of positive
        tests. These rules should be absolute rules meaning that they are mathematically correct and
        not just assumptions or "most of the time correct". The rules can be run in data
        entry, after filling each form, or as a more batch like process on multiple forms at the
        same time, e.g. for all facilities for the previous reporting month. The results of the
        tests will list all violations and the detailed values for each side of the expression where
        the violation occurred to make it easy to go back to data entry and correct the
        values.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e538"></a>8.4.5.&nbsp;Indicators</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Indicators represent perhaps the most powerful data analysis feature of the DHIS 2. While data elements represent the raw data (counts) being collected the indicators represent formulas providing coverage rates, incidence rates, ratios and other formula-based units of analysis. An indicator is made up of a factor (e.g. 1, 100, 100, 100 000), a numerator and a denominator, the two latter are both  expressions based on one or more data elements. E.g. the indicator "BCG coverage &lt;1 year" is defined a formula with a factor 100, a numerator ("BCG doses given to children under 1 year") and a denominator ("Target population under 1 year"). The indicator "DPT1 to DPT3 drop out rate" is a formula of 100 %   x ("DPT1 doses given"- "DPT3 doses given") / ("DPT1 doses given"). </p>
      <p>Most report modules in DHIS 2 support both data elements and indicators and you can also combine these in custom reports, but the important difference and strength of indicators versus raw data (data element's data values) is the ability to compare data across different geographical areas (e.g. highly populated vs rural areas)  as the target population can be used in the denominator.</p>
      <p>Indicators can be added, modified and deleted at any point in time without interfering with the data values in the database. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e543"></a>8.4.6.&nbsp;Report tables and reports</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Standard reports in DHIS 2 is a very flexible way of presenting the data that has been collected. Data can be aggregated by any organisational unit or orgunit level, by data element, by indicators, as well as over time (e.g. monthly, quarterly, yearly). The report tables are custom data sources for the standard reports and can be flexibly defined in the user interface  and later accessed in external report designers such as iReport or BIRT. These report designs can then be set up as easily accessible one-click reports with parameters so that the users can run the same reports e.g. every month when new data is entered, and also be relevant to users at all levels as the organisational unit can be selected at the time of running the report.</p>

      <p>In the integrated GIS module you can easily display your data on maps, both on polygons
        (areas) and as points (health facilities), and either as data elements or indicators. By
        providing the coordinates of your organisational units to the system you can quickly get up
        to speed with this module. See the GIS section for details on how to get started. </p>

      <p>On of the easiest way to display your indicator data is through charts. An easy to use chart dialogue will guide you through the creation of various types of charts with data on indicators, organisational units and periods of your choice. These charts can easily be added to one of the four chart sections on your dashboard and there be made easily available right after log in. Make sure to set the dashboard module as the start module in user settings. </p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dataEntry"></a>9.1.&nbsp;Data entry with DHIS 2</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>To open the data entry window click on the services tab displayed in the main menu. A
    drop down menu will appear listing the services provided by DHIS 2. Click
    on the <span class="guibutton">Data Entry</span> option.</p>
    <p>The data entry module is where data is manually registered in the DHIS 2 database. Data is registered for an organisation unit, a period, and a set of data elements (data set) at a time. A data set often corresponds to a paper-based data collection tool. </p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e559"></a>9.1.1.&nbsp;Selecting the data entry form</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>To start entering data the first step is to open the correct form by following these
        steps:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Locate the orgunit you want to register data for in the tree menu to the left.
            Expand and close branches by clicking on the +/- symbols. A quick way to find an orgunit
            is to use the search box just above the tree (the green symbol), but you need to write
            in the full name to get a match.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Select a data set from the dropdown list of data sets available to your selected orgunit.  </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Select a period to register data for. The available periods are controlled by the
            period type of the data set (reporting frequency). You can jump a year back or forward
            by using the arrows above the period.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
      <p>By now you should see the data entry form. From a form design perspective, there are
        three types for forms: default forms, section forms and custom forms. If a custom form
        exists, it will be displayed, followed in order of precedence by a section form, and finally
        a default form.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/data_entry/data_entry_overview.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e575"></a>9.1.2.&nbsp;Entering data</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Start entering data by clicking inside the first field and type in the value. Move to
        the next field using the Tab button. Shift+Tab will take you back one step. You can also use
        the "up" and "down" arrow keys to navigate between the form cells. The values are saved
        immediately and do not require to be saved at a later stage. A green field indicates that
        the value has been saved in the system (on the server).</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Input validation:</strong></span> If you type in an invalid value, e.g.
        a character in a field that only accepts numeric values you will get a pop-up that explains
        the problem and the field will be coloured yellow (not saved) until you have corrected the
        value. If you have defined a min/max range for the field (data element+organisation unit
        combination) a pop-up message will notify you when the value is out of range, and the value
        will remain unsaved until you have changed the value (or updated the range and then
        re-entered the value). </p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Disabled fields:</strong></span> If a field is disabled (grey) it means
        that the field can and should not be filled. The cursor will automatically jump to the next
        open field. </p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Data history:</strong></span> By double-clicking on any input field in the form a data history window opens showing the last 12 values registered for the current field (organisation unit+data element+categoryoptioncombo) in a bar chart. This window also shows the min and max range and allows for adjusting the range for the specific organisation unit and data element combination. </p>

      </div>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Follow Up:</strong></span>  In the data history window there is also a feature to tag or star a value. E.g. a suspicious value that needs further investigation can be kept in the system, but marked for Follow-Up. In the Data Quality module you can run a Follow-Up analysis and view all values marked for Follow-Up, and then later edit the values if proved incorrect.  </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e591"></a>9.1.3.&nbsp;Editing and deleting data</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>If you wish to enter data which has already been entered, simply replace the data entry value with the update values. </p>
      <p>If you want to delete a data value completely, you should select the value of interest, and press "Delete" on your keyboard. If you enter a zero and the data element has been configured to not store zeros, the previous data value (i.e. the one you wish to modify) will not be overwritten with the new value. Therefore, it is better practice to delete the data value completely (waiting for the cell to turn green) and then to enter the new value. </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dataEntry_1"></a>9.1.4.&nbsp;Validating data in the form</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>When all the available values for the form has been filled in you can run a validation check on the data in the form. Click on the "Run Validation" button in the top right corner. All validation rules which involves data elements in the current form (dataset) will be run against the new data. Upon completion you will be presented with a list of violations or a simply a message that says "The data entry screen successfully passed validation".  See the Data Quality chapter for information on how to define such validation rules.</p>
      <p>When you have corrected any erroneous values and are done with the form the recommended practice is to click on the Complete button below the form to register the form as complete. This information is used when generating completeness reports for district, county, province or the national level.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e604"></a>9.1.5.&nbsp;Offline data entry</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The data entry module will function even if during data entry the Internet connectivity
        is not stable. In order to utilize this functionality, you must login to the server while
        Internet connectivity is present, but if during data entry, the Internet link between your
        computer and the server becomes unstable, data can still be entered into the data entry
        form, saved to your local computer, and then pushed to the server once the Internet
        connectivity has been restored. Data can be entered and stored locally while being offline
        and uploaded to the central server when on-line. This means that the on-line deployment
        strategy will be more viable in areas with unstable Internet connectivity. The total
        bandwidth usage is greatly reduced since forms no longer are retrieved from the server for
        each rendering.</p>
      <p>When the server is able to be reached through the Internet connection, a message is displayed  at the top of the data entry screen  below. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_entry/data_entry_online.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>If the Internet connection should disconnect for some reason during the data entry process, this will be detected by the application, and you will be informed that your data will be stored locally. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_entry/data_entry_offline.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Data entry can proceed as normal. Once you have entered all of the necessary data, and the application detects that the server is back on-line, you will be informed that you have data which needs to be synchronized with the server. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_entry/data_entry_offline_upload1.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Once the data has successfully synchronized with the server, you will receive a confirmation message that the data has been successfully uploaded to the server. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">

      <p>In some scenarios it is beneficial to enter data for multiple organisation units in the
        same data entry form, for instance if there are few data elements in the form and a huge
        number of organisation units in the hierarchy. In that case you can enable
        multi-organisation unit data entry by going to "System settings" and tick the "Enable multi
        organisation unit forms" setting. Then, in data entry, select the organisation unit
        immediately above the organisation unit you want to enter for in the hierarchy. Note that
        this only work for the "section" based forms. You should now see the data elements appearing
        as columns and the organisation units appearing as rows in the form. Note that the data
        entry forms should still be assigned to the facilities that you actually enter data for,
        i.e. the organisation units now appearing in the form.</p>

  <p>The data quality module provides means to improve the accuracy and reliability of the data in the system. This can be done through validation rules and various statistical checks. All the functionality described below can be accessed from the left side menu in the Services-&gt;Data Quality module.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e633"></a>10.1.&nbsp;Overview of data quality checks</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Ensuring data quality is a key concern in building an effective HMIS. Data quality has different dimensions including:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Correctness:</em></span> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Completeness:</em></span> Data for all data elements for all health facilities should have been submitted.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Consistency:</em></span> Data should be consistent with data entered during earlier months and years while allowing for changes with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and consistent with other similar facilities.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Timeliness:</em></span> All data from all reporting orgunits should be submitted at the appointed time.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e649"></a>10.2.&nbsp;Data quality checks</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Data quality checking can be done through various means, including:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>At point of data entry, the software can check the data entered to see if it falls within the min-max ranges of that data element (based on all previous data registered).</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Defining various validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry. The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and Organization Unit(s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for these validation rules. </p>

  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="validationRuleAnalysis"></a>10.3.&nbsp;Running Validation Rule Analysis</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>You can access Validation Rule Analysis from the Services-&gt;Data Quality menu.</p>
    <p>A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator  which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are met. For instance, a validation rule could  assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</p>
    <p>The validation rule analysis function will test validation rules against the data
      registered in the system. Validation violations will be reported in cases where the condition
      defined through the validation rule expression is not met, i.e. the condition is false.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Selecting what data to validate:</strong></span> </p>
    <p>First, enter a start date and an end date for which data should be included in the analysis. The date picker widget may be used to select dates. </p>
    <p>Second, choose between including all validation rules or all validation rules from a single group. </p>
    <p>Third, choose between including the selected organisation unit only or the selected organisation unit with all children in the analysis. Fourth, select the organisation unit. Finally, click <span class="italic">validate</span>.</p>

    </div>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Validation results:</strong></span></p>
    <p>The analysis process will run for a while depending on the amount of data that is being analysed. If there were no violations of the validation rules a message saying <span class="italic">validation passed successfully</span> is displayed. </p>
    <p>If validation violations were found, they will be presented in a list. The organisation unit, period, left side description and value, operator, and right side value and description for each validation violation are displayed. </p>
    <p>The show details icon can be clicked in order to get more information about a validation violation. This will open a popup screen that provides information about the data elements included in the validation rules and their corresponding data values. This information can be used in order to fix incorrect data.</p>
    <p>The validation violations can be exported to a PDF document by clicking on the Download as PDF button, and to a Microsoft Excel workbook by clicking on the Download as Excel button.</p>

    <p>You can access Outlier analysis from the Services-&gt;Data Quality menu.</p>
    <p>The standard deviation based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values
      that are numerically distant from the rest of the data. Outliers can occur by chance, but they
      often indicate a measurement error or a heavy-tailed distribution (leading to very high
      numbers). In the former case one wishes to discard them while in the latter case one should be
      cautious in using tools or interpretations that assume a normal distribution. The analysis is
      based on the standard normal distribution.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Select what data to analyse:</strong></span></p>
    <p>First, select the from and to date for the data to include in the analysis. </p>
    <p>Second, select the data set from which to pick data elements from. </p>
    <p>Third, select all or some of the data elements in the data set by double-clicking or marking them and clicking the add/remove buttons. </p>
    <p>Fourth, select the parent organisation unit to use. All children of the organisation unit will be included. </p>
    <p>Fifth, select the number of standard deviations. This refers to the number of standard
      deviations the data is allowed to deviate from the mean before it is classified as an
      outlier.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/outlier_analysis_selection.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Analysis result:</strong></span></p>
    <p>The potential outlier values discovered will be presented in a list after the analysis process is finished. The data element, organisation unit, period, minimum value, actual value, and maximum value will be displayed for each outlier. The minimum and maximum values refer to the border values derived from the number of standard deviations selected for the analysis. </p>
    <p>Each outlier value can be modified directly in the analysis result page. The value can be modified by clicking inside the corresponding field in the value column, entering a value and then navigate away from that field either by clicking tab or anywhere outside the field. The system will provide an alert if the value is still outside the defined minimum and maximum values, but the value will saved in any case. The field will have a red background color if the value is outside the range, and a green if inside. </p>
    <p>Each outlier value can be marked for further follow-up by clicking the star icon.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="minmaxoutlierAnalysis"></a>10.5.&nbsp;Min-Max Outlier Analysis</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The min-max value based outlier analysis provides a mechanism for revealing values that are outside the  pre-defined minimum and maximum values. Minimum and maximum values can be custom defined or automatically defined by the system in the data administration module. See the section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gapAnalysis"></a>10.6.&nbsp;Gap Analysis</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The gap analysis provides a mechanism for revealing gaps in the data. A gap exists for a specific data element and organisation unit. A gap is a period with  preceding and succeeding periods which have registered data values, but without registered data values itself. Such a gap might indicate a data capture error or omission and could be further investigated.  See the section about Std dev outlier analysis for further details on usage.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="followupAnalysis"></a>10.7.&nbsp;Follow-Up Analysis</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The follow-up analysis function will list all data values which are marked for follow-up.
      A data value can be marked for follow-up in the data entry module and in the other validation
      analysis variants in this module.</p>

    <p>The data visualizer module enables users to easily create dynamic data analysis and visualizations through charts and data tables.  You can freely select content (like indicators, periods and organisation units) for your analysis. This module can be accessed by going to "Services - Data Visualizer" in the main menu. The image below shows the viewport of the module. For a quick start:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p> Look under the "Indicator" heading and select an indicator group from the list of groups. </p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Look under "Available indicators" and select a few indicators from the list by double-clicking on them.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Click "Update" in the top bar and see the chart unfold.</p>
      </li></ol></div>
    <p>The data visualizer is designed firstly to be easy-to-use - you can simply select the indicators, data elements, periods and organisation units you want to include and click "Update" to get your visualization. Secondly it is designed  to be fast and work well over poor Internet connections - charts are generated in the web browser and very little data is transferred over the Internet.</p>

    <p>The visualizer module provides seven different chart types, each with different characteristics. You can select the type of your chart by clicking on one of the icons  in  top left bar titled "Chart type".</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Column chart: Chart which displays information as vertical rectangular columns with
          lengths proportional to the values they represent. Useful e.g. for comparing performance
          of different districts.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Stacked column chart: Chart with vertical rectangular columns where bars representing
          multiple categories are stacked on top of each other. Useful e.g. for displaying trends or
          sums of related data elements.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">

      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Line chart: Graph which displays information as a series of points connected by
          straight lines. Also referred to as time series. Useful e.g. to visualize trends in
          indicator data over multiple time periods.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Area chart: Chart which is based on line chart, with the space between the axis and the line filled with colors and the lines stacked on top of each other. Useful for comparing the trends of related indicators.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Pie chart: Circular chart divided into sectors (or slices). Useful e.g. to visualize
          the proportion of data for individual data elements compared to the total sum of all data
          elements in the chart.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Radar chart: Displaying multivariate data on axes starting from the same point. Also known as spider chart.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dvSeriesCategoryFilter"></a>11.3.&nbsp;Selecting series, category and filter</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>This section lets you define which dimension of the data you want to appear as series, category and filter. This asks for a closer explanation. Dimension in this regard refers to the elements which describe the data values in the system. We have three main dimensions in the system:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Data: Includes data elements, indicators and datasets (reporting rates), describing the phenomena or event of the data.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Periods: Describes when the event took place.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Organisation units: Describes where the event took place.</p>
      </li></ol></div>
    <p>The visualization module lets you use these dimensions completely flexible in terms of appearing as series, categories and filter. Understanding these concepts is most easily done by looking at the screenshot from the opening page below: </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="70%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/visualizer/series_category_filter.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>More formally this can be described as following:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Series: A series is a set of continuous, related elements (e.g. periods or data
          elements) which you want to visualize in order to emphasize trends or relations in its
          data.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Categories: A category is a set of elements (e.g. indicators or organisation units)
          for which you want to compare its data.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Filter: Since most charts are two-dimensional, a filter must be used on the third dimension  in order to use only a single element for the chart to become meaningful.</p>
      </li></ol></div>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e781"></a>11.4.&nbsp;Selecting indicators and data elements</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The visualizer module can display any number of indicators and data elements in a chart and data table. Both indicators and data elements can be selected and appear together in the same chart. You can select indicators by clicking at the "Indicators" header  and selecting an indicator group from the list of groups below it. This will make the indicators in the selected group appear in the list under "Available indicators" to the left. From that list you can double click on any indicator in order to select it, this will move it to the list under "Selected indicators". Alternatively you can mark one or more indicators and click the single-arrow button. To select all indicators you simply click on the double-arrow button. To deselect indicators you can do correspondingly in the "Selected indicators" list.</p>
    <p>To select data elements click on the "Data elements" header. The same principle for selecting and deselecting applies as for indicators.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e785"></a>11.5.&nbsp;Selecting reporting rates</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The visualizer can display reporting rates in a chart, by itself or together with indicators and data elements. Reporting rates can be selected by clicking at the "Reporting rates" header. Reporting rates are defined by data sets. It can be selected by double-clicking in the list of available data sets to the left.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e788"></a>11.6.&nbsp;Selecting fixed and relative periods</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Click on the "Periods" header. For fixed periods, select a period type from the combo box. You can select any number of fixed periods from any period type. Below the fixed period you will find the relative period checkboxes and you may select as many as you like. The names should be fairly self-descriptive and they are relative to the current date, meaning that if the current month is March and you select "Last month", the month of February will be included in the chart. You are also free to combine fixed periods and relative periods in the same chart. Overlapping periods will be filtered so that they only appear once.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e791"></a>11.7.&nbsp;Selecting organisation units</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>You can select which organisation units to include in the chart by clicking the
      "Organisation units" header. This section features three ways of selecting organisation units. The default mode is called "Organisation units" and lets you select the organisation units you want to appear in the chart from the tree. This mode also features three checkboxes. Checking "User org unit" will disable the organisation unit tree and give you the organisation unit that is related to the current/logged in user instead. This is also useful for administrators as they can create a meaningful "system" favorite with this option checked and all users will find their respective organisation unit when they open it. The the same concept goes for "Org unit children" and "Org unit grand children". The second mode is called "Select levels". Here you can select all organisation units at one or more levels. However, at the same time you also have the option to select parent organisation units in the tree, which makes it easy to select e.g. all facilities inside one or more districts. The same thing goes for the third mode called "Select groups". Here you can select all organisation units inside one or more groups and parent organisation units at the same time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e794"></a>11.8.&nbsp;Selecting organisation unit group sets and data element group sets</h2></div></div></div>
	
	<p>All dimension tabs listed below "Organisation units" are organisation unit group sets and data element group sets. You are free to add groups from any of these group sets to your chart. Remember to add the group set in either the series, category or filters combobox.</p>

    <p>You can display a chart based on your selections simply by clicking the "Update" button on the top centre menu. This requires that you have selected one or more elements from all of the three dimensions - data (indicators, data elements, reporting rates), periods (relative, fixed) and organisation units (units or groups). Note that "Months this year" from the period dimension and the root organisation unit are selected by default.</p>
    <p>Notice that you can hide and show individual data series in the chart by clicking directly on the series label in the chart - they appear either at the top or to the right of the chart.</p>
    <p>If you want to give the chart more space on your screen you can click on the triple left-arrow button on the top centre menu. This will collapse the left side menu. You can get this menu back by clicking on the same button again.</p>

Setting up the dashboard</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#d5e877">12.2. Messages and feedback</a></span></dt></dl></div>
  
  <p>Dashboards are intended to provide quick access to individual users to the data which has been stored in DHIS2. Dashboards consist of several sections, some of which provide links to reports or mapview which have already been defined. Other sections of the dashboard allow users to add charts which have been defined and made available through the charting module. </p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dashboards_setup"></a>12.1.&nbsp;Setting up the dashboard</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The dashboard is divided into two main sections. The right-side pane (denoted as A in the screenshot below) can be used to contain links to reports, documents (static reports), report tables, map views, and an RSS Health feed. The left-side zone (denoted as B in the screen shot)  can be used to contain up to six separate charts which have been previously created in the charting reporting module. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dashboard/dashboard_main.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>In this screen shot, the dashboard has already been populated with a number of reports and mapviews. Simply clicking on one of the blue links will bring you automatically to the report or map view. Clicking on one of the charts will display a larger chart, which you can save as an image, and include in a report or other document. </p>
    <p>You can redefine the structure of the dashboard by clearing the each of the windows by clicking the "Clear" link. By clicking "Insert" again, you can then select a new chart to appear in the window. </p>
    <p>All reports, documents, report tables and charts can be added to the list of available options by clicking on the "Add to dashboard" icon <img src="resources/images/dhis2_images/add_to_dashboard.png"> in each of the respective modules. Please refer to the sections to each of the sections in this manual for more detailed instructions. Once you have added the object to the list of available objects, you can"Insert" it on the dashboard.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e877"></a>12.2.&nbsp;Messages and feedback</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>DHIS2 has certain functions to facilitate communication between different users and user groups. This type of communication is important to facilitate feedback regarding data quality,  timeliness of submissions, or to simply answer a question which a particular user may have. </p>
    <p>Feedback messages are sent to a particular group of users and can be sent by all users who
      have access to the dashboard module. In order to enable the receipt of feedback messages sent
      from the dashboard, you must set the system setting "Feedback recipients" which is
      available from the Maintenance-&gt;System settings dialog. Be sure to define a user group
      (e.g. "Feedback recipients") with all of the users who should receive feedback
      messages. Refer to the section in this manual on "User groups" for more information
      of how to do this. Once the "Feedback recipients" user group has been defined, each
      time a feedback message is sent, it will appear as a message in each of the "Feedback
      recipients" message queue within DHIS2. Note that messages will not be sent to users
      email addresses, but will only appear within the DHIS2 application. </p>
    <p>To send a new feedback message, simply select "Write feedback" from the dashboard. Provide a subject and text in the respective text boxes. The message will appear in all of the specified users message queue. </p>
    <p>Messages can be sent to specific groups of users who have been assigned to particular organisation units. To write a new message, simply click "Messages" from the dashboard screen and then press the "Write message" button.. Select an organisation unit (or group of organisation units) from the "Recipients" organisational unit tree. Provide a Subject and Text. To send the message, press the "Send" button. You can discard the message by pressing the "Discard" button as seen in the screenshot below.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="ou_hierarchy"></a>14.1.&nbsp;The organisational hierarchy</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The organisational hierarchy defines the organisation structure of the DHIS2 instance, such as how  the health facilities, administrative areas and other geographical areas are arranged with respect to each other. It is essentially the "where" dimension of DHIS2, similar to how periods represent the "when" or time dimension. DHIS2 is structured so that the organisational unit hierarchy is a geographical hierarchy, and the GIS module depends on this. Non-geographical hierarchies are discouraged, and would better to be represented through the use of organisational unit groups. This dimension to the data is defined as a hierarchy with one root unit (e.g. Ministry of Health or a country) and any number of levels and nodes below. Each node in this hierarchy is called an organisational unit in DHIS2. </p>
    <p>The design of this hierarchy will determine the  geographical units of analysis available to the users  as data is collected and aggregated in this structure. There can only be one organisational hierarchy at the same time so its structure needs careful consideration. </p>
    <p>Additional  hierarchies (e.g. parallel administrative boundaries to the health care sector) can be modeled using organisational groups and group sets, but the organisational hierarchy is the main vehicle for data aggregation on the geographical dimension. Typically national organisational hierarchies in public health have 4-6 levels, but any number of levels is supported. </p>
    <p>The hierarchy is built up of parent-child relations. For instance a country  might have eight provinces, and each province again  might have a number of districts as their children. Normally the health facilities (from which data is typically collected)  will be located at the lowest level, but they can also be located at higher levels, e.g. national or provincial hospitals, so skewed organisational trees are supported (e.g. a leaf node can be positioned at level 2 while most other leaf nodes are at level 5). </p>
    <p>Note that it is quite easy to make changes to the upper levels of the hierarchy at a later stage, the only problem is changing organisational units that collect data (the leaf nodes), e.g.  splitting or merging health facilities. Aggregation up the hierarchy is done based on the current hierarchy at any time and will always reflect the most recent changes to the organisational structure. </p>
    <div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Important"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Important]" src="resources/images/admon/important.png"></td><th align="left">Important</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
      <p>Because the most recent information which is contained in the organisational unit hierarchy is always used for aggregation, it is important to keep in mind that changes to it (such as the division of districts into two separate districts) will not be respected over time. As an example, District A may be sub-divided into District B and District C. This is a process which often happens for political reasons. Facilities which belong to District A would need to be reassigned to District B and C. However, any historical data, which was entered before the split actually occurred, would still be registered as belonging to District B and C and not the defunct District A. This temporal representation of the organisational hierarchy across time will be lost. </p>

      <p>This is where you can create organisation units (from now on referred to as orgunits) and build up the orgunit hierarchy. Orgunits are added one by one as either root unit or a child of a selected unit. The left side menu represents the current organisational hierarchy and if you select a unit there you will see its children listed in the main list of orgunits in the middle of the screen. When an orgunit is selected in the left side menu you can also add new child units to it. To locate an orgunit in the hierarchy you can either navigate through the tree by expanding the branches (click on the + symbol), or search for it by opening the search field (click the green symbol above the root of the hierarchy). In search you can either search for the orgunit name or its code, both will only show exact matches (case-insensitive). To add a new orgunit first select its parent and then click on the Add new button in the top right corner of the list of orgunits. To add a new root orgunit make sure no orgunit is selected in the menu and click on "Add new".

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ou_groupsets"></a>14.2.2.&nbsp;Organisation unit group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Group sets can be understood as a flexible tool to add more categorisation to orgunits. Any number of group sets can be added, but as a default start all databases will have the two group sets "Type" and "Ownership". Using these  group sets will simplify how reporting is done, and facilitate analysis through the use of tools such as Excel PivotTables.</p>
      <p>While a group set like "Type" describes a measure dimension, the actual
        categories are represented by the groups, and the categorisation of an orgunit through the
        orgunit's group memberships. This can be understood as a parallel hierarchy of orgunits
        with the group set as the root ("Type"), the groups at level 2 (e.g.
        "Clinic", "Hospital", "Dispensary"), and the actual orgunits
        at level 3. The group set can as such provide additional information and dimensionality to
        the data analysis as data is easily filtered, organised, or aggregated by groups within a
        group set. </p>
      <p>For this aggregation to work without any duplication in the data some rules are necessary. A group set is always exclusive, which means that an orgunit cannot be member of more than one group in a group set. Therefore, when creating a new organisational unit, you will only be allowed to select a single organisational group membership for each group set. Furthermore it is possible to define whether a group set is compulsory or not, which will affect the completeness of the data when analysing data using group sets. Compulsory means that ALL orgunits must be member of a group in that group set. </p>
      <p>We recommend that you approach the orgunit grouping in the following sequence (and one group set at a time):</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Define a new group set, such as "Location". </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Add new  groups  (such as "Urban", "Rural" and "Peri-urban"). Once all groups have been defined, return to the organisational unit group set and assign each of the desired groups to the group set.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Go back to each group, one by one, go to edit mode and assign the orgunits that should be member of the group. Should you follow this route, you can place multiple organisation units at a time in a group. However, you must be careful not to place the same organisational units in two groups which itself is a member of an organisation unit group set. This will result in a data integrity violation. If you have organisation unit groups which are not exclusive, they should not be members of a group. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>A better way to ensure that you do not mistakenly assign an organisation unit to
            multiple members of a group set is you can use the edit feature of each organisational
            unit to assign memberships to each group set. You will only be able to assign a single
            organisation unit at a time however.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
      <p>It is important to keep in mind when using the "Organisational unit group" set function, that unless great care is taken, organisational units can be assigned to multiple groups of a group set. This can be checked through the "Data Integrity" module, which will report which organisational units are not members of a compulsory organisational unit group set, and which organisational units have been assigned to more than one member of a group set. </p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="ou_groupsets_edit"></a>14.2.2.1.&nbsp;Editing organisation unit group sets</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>Click on the name of the organisation unit group set you wish to modify, followed by "Edit" from the context menu which will appear.  The following properties can be defined in the Edit (or Create new) window:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p>Name: Provide a precise name for the group set.</p>

            <p>Description: Describe the phenomena the group set is measuring/capturing.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Compulsory: Indicate whether ALL orgunits need to be member of a group in this group set or not.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Available groups/Selected groups: Here you assign groups to your group set by using the arrow buttons to move  highlighted groups between the two lists (/selected). If no groups appear in the  list then you must go to orgunit groups and create new groups there first. Note that assigning groups that will violate the exclusive rule on group sets is not possible, e.g. adding a group that already has assigned an orgunit that again is already member of a group that has already  been selected by this group set, will not be possible since one orgunit will end up with two group memberships in the same group set. To avoid such situations we recommend first adding groups to group sets, and then orgunits to groups.</p>

      <p>Data elements form the basis of DHIS2. Data elements define what is actually recorded in system, e.g. number of immunisations or number of cases of malaria. The actual creation and definition of the data elements themselves are far beyond the scope of this manual to describe, but it is assumed that an administrator will be provided with a list of standardised data elements for inclusion into the DHIS2 system. </p>
      <p>To access the data element maintenance module, choose Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and Indicators -&gt; Data element. </p>
      <p>The 'Filter by name' will allow you to filter a range of data elements if you know either the full name of the data element, or just a part of it. Type the name

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dataElementCategory"></a>15.1.5.&nbsp;Categories</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Categories can be used to disaggregate data elements into individual atomic components. They can also be used to assign attributes to all data recorded in a specific dataset, such as "Implementing partner" and "Funding agency." </p>
      <p> Data element categories are typically a concept, such as Gender, Age or  Disease Status. Data elements such as "Number of cases of confirmed malaria" are often broken into smaller component parts to determine, for instance, the number of confirmed malaria cases of particular age groups. As an example, three data element categories: Under 1, 1-5 and Over 5 could be created. They could be assigned as categories to the data element, which would then create in the data entry screens, three separate fields for this data element namely: </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>Number of confirmed malaria cases (Under 1)</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Number of confirmed malaria cases (1-5)</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Number of confirmed malaria cases (Over 5)</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p>Effective use of data element categories greatly simplifies the process of setting up the DHIS2 system, as the data element categories can be reused to disaggregate many different data elements. Otherwise, each of the data elements listed above, would need to be created separately. Judicious use of data element categories will greatly simplify the DHIS2 implementation, and allow for subsequent advanced analysis. </p>
      <p>Where possible, category options should be recycled. For instance, there might be two categories which might share a particular category option (e.g. &lt;1 year of age). When creating the  categories, this category option could be reused. This is important if particular category options (or category option combinations) need to be analyzed together. </p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p> All possible category options should be defined.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Categories should be composed of multiple category options created in Step 1. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Category combinations should be composed of either one, or multiple categories.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Data elements should be created and assigned a particular category combination. </p>
        </li></ol></div>
      <p>A  category option consists of a name, along with an optional code, and a concept. </p>
      <p>Categories can be added by accessing the "Data Element Category Option" dialog. (Maintenance -&gt; Data Elements and Indicators-&gt;Data Element Category Options" as seen below. The category option must consist of a name, an optional code, and a concept. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="50%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/maintainence/data_element_category_options.PNG" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Once all category options have been defined for a particular category, the category can be defined with the "Data Element Category" dialog.(Maintenance -&gt; Data Elements and Indicators-&gt;Data Element Category). Enter the name of the data element category and press "Save". Once you have defined the name of the category, you can assign category options to it by selecting the category which you have just defined, clicking its name, and then selecting "Edit" from the context menu as seen below. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/maintainence/data_element_categories_add_new.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Type the name of the new data element category in the "Name" field in the "Details" region and assign a concept to the category.  Category options can be added by moving category options from the left-side pane (Available category options) into the right-side pane(Selected category options). Category options can be reordered using the "Move Up"<img src="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_up.png" align="middle"> and "Move Down"<img src="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_down.png" align="middle"> buttons. . Once all data element categories options have been added to the data element category, press the <span class="guibutton">"Add"</span> button to save all changes or the <span class="guibutton">"Cancel"</span>  button to discard any changes.</p>
      <p>A  category can have two types "Disaggregation" or "Attribute". For disaggregation of data elements, you should select "Disaggregation".  A dimension type of "Attribute" will allow the category to be used to assign a combination of categories to data recorded through a dataset.</p>
      <p>If the "Use as data dimension" box is ticked, the category will be available to the analytics as another dimension, in addition to the standard dimensions of "Period" and "Organisation unit". </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dataElementCategoryCombo"></a>15.1.6.&nbsp;Category combinations</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Category combinations allow multiple categories to be combined into a related set. As an example, a data element "Number of new HIV infections" might be disaggregated according to the following categories. </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>Age: "Under 5", "5-15", "15-24", "24 and above"</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Gender: Male, Female</p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p> In this example, there would be two levels of disaggregation, consisting of two separate data element categories, each consisting of several data element category options. In most HMIS systems, different data elements are disaggregated according to a common set of categories. By combining these different categories into a category combination and assigning these combinations to data elements, the appropriate disaggregation levels can be applied efficiently and quickly to a large number of data elements. </p>
      <p>To access the  category combination maintenance module, select "Maintenance-&gt;Data element and indicators-&gt;Data element category combinations" from the main DHIS2 menu. As with the  other maintains modules, you can filter the listed category combinations by entering the name (or portion thereof) of the category combination. Other operations such as "Edit", "Delete" and "Information" should be familiar to the reader. </p>
      <p>To add a new category combination, click the "Add new" button. The following dialogue will be displayed. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/maintainence/data_element_category_combo_add_new.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Type the name of the category combination in the "Name" field, and then select the desired categories from the left panel. Press the "Move right" button to add the selected categories to the category combination. Press "Move left" to remove any categories that should not be part of the category combination. </p>
      <p>Categories can only be added to a category combination at this step. Categories can be removed from category combinations later by editing the category combination, however, it is not allowed to add additional categories once the combination has been created. Ensure that the category combination and its respective categories is final before you create the category combination and assign it to a data element. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1269"></a>15.1.7.&nbsp;Using categories as attributes</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>In some deployments of DHIS2, information on attributes such as "Implementing partner" and "Project" are important to record as an attribute of each data value. To provide an example, let us suppose that an NGO is providing ART services in a given facility. They would need to report each month on the "ART monthly summary", which would be reported monthly and contain a number of data elements.  The NGO and project could potentially change over time. In order to be able to effectively attribute data to a given NGO and project at any point in time, this information would need to be recorded along with each data value at the time of data entry. </p>
      <p>When categories and category combinations have a type of "Attribute", they can serve as a means of applying a common set of attributes (e.g. Implementing partner and project) to a related set of data values contained in a dataset. Let us suppose we create two categories called "Implementing partner" and "Projects". Each of these categories would be created with a dimension type of "Attribute."   Finally, a category combination called "Implementing partners and projects" would be created with these two categories and assigned a dimension type of "Attribute". Finally, we can use this dimension to apply an attribute to the dataset "ART monthly summary", by choosing  the "Implementing partners and projects" as the "Combination of categories". </p>
      <p>The following screen shot of an example data entry screen illustrates all of these concepts. </p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/maintainence/categories_dataset_attributes.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Note that when data is entered, an "Implementing partner" and "Project" can be selected. Each data value recorded in this data entry screen, would be assigned a specific combination of these categories as an attribute. These attributes (when specified as a dimension) can be used in the analysis modules similar to other dimensions, such as the period and orgunit.  In summary, when category combinations are used as attribute, they effectively serve as another dimension (similar to "Period" and "Organisationion unit") which can be used for analysis. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1279"></a>15.1.8.&nbsp;Category option groups and group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Category options can be groups and classified using category option groups. Category
        option groups can be created from "Category option group" &gt; "Add new", and contains a set of
        category options.</p>
      <p>Category option groups can be included in category option group sets. Category option
        group sets can be created from "Category option group set" &gt; "Add new", and contains a set
        of category option groups.</p>
      <p>The main purpose of the these entities is to be able to add more dimensionality to your
        captured data for analysis in apps such as pivot table and data visualizer. An example of
        where this becomes useful: In a system, data is collected by "projects", where projects is
        modeled as category options. The system is required to do data analysis according to which
        donor supports the project. In this case, a category option group set called "Donor" can be
        created. Each donor can be created as a category option group, where each category option /
        project is put in the appropriate group. In data analysis apps, the "Donor" group set will
        appear as a data dimension, while each donor appear as dimension items, ready for inclusion
        in reports.</p>

    <p>All data entry in DHIS2 is organised through the use of data sets. You can add and edit
      data sets in Maintenance-&gt;Data sets. A data set is a collection of data elements grouped
      together for data collection and data export between instances of DHIS2 (e.g. from a district
      office local installation to a national server). </p>
    <p>A data set has a data collection frequency which can be set through the period type
      property. The frequency can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly.
      Which data elements to include in the data set and the frequency are set in the Add/Edit Data
      set window. In order to use a data set to collect data for a specific orgunit you must assign
      the orgunit to the data set, and this mechanism controls which org units that can use which
      data sets. </p>
    <p>Data sets also are assigned to specific organisation units which will be allowed to enter
      data for all data elements in that data set. You can assign org units to a data set in the
      Data set management by clicking on the blue folder icon, the first icon under Operations, next
      to the data set you would like to modify. Alternatively you can manage orgunit assignments for

          for this data set. Expiry days refer to the number of days after the end date of the
          selected data entry period where the data entry form should be open for entry. After the
          number of days has expired, the data set will be locked for further entry. You can set

          category option combination), then she must enter data for all fields belonging to that
          data element (i.e. all category option combinations).</p>

      <p>Before reading this section it is recommended to familiarize oneself with the sections
        on categories in the data element chapter. Whereas data element categories can be used for
        capturing disaggregations of data elements, data set categories are used to capture
        information which is common to an entire form.</p>
      <p>To set up categories for data set, start by creating category options, categories and
        category combinations like described in the data element chapter. Make sure that you set the
        type of categories and category combinations to "Attribute". To assign a category
        combination to a data set, you can select it while creating or updating the data set from
        the "Combination of categories" drop-down box.</p>
      <p>When a data set is linked to a category combination, those categories will be displayed
        as drop-down boxes in the data entry module. Data captured in the form will then be linked
        to the selected category options from those drop-down boxes.</p>
      <p>An scenario for when data set categories are useful is when you need to capture a data
        entry form for a implementer partner organisation and a project. In that case, start by
        creating category options and categories for all partner organisations and projects, before
        linking these in a new category combination. Then, link the category combination to the data
        set (form) for which you need to capture this information. When opening this data set in
        data entry module, the partner organisation and project categories will automatically be
        rendered as drop-down boxes, allowing you to select a specific implementing partner
        organisation and project before continuing to do data entry.</p>

    <p>Once you have assigned a data set to an orgunit that data set will be made available in
      Data Entry for the orgunits you have assigned it to.  A default data entry form will then be
      shown, which is simply a list of the data elements belonging to the data set together with a
      column for inputting the values. If your data set contains data elements with a non-default
      categorycombination, such as age groups or gender then additional columns will be
      automatically generated in the default form based on the different options/dimensions. </p>
    <p>If you use more than one dataelement category combination you will get multiple columns in the data entry form with different column headings for the options. In addition to the default list-based data entry form there are two more alternatives, the section-based form and the custom form.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1373"></a>16.2.1.&nbsp;Section forms</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Section forms allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using tabular forms and
        are quick and simple to design. Often your data entry form will need multiple tables with
        subheadings, and sometimes you need to disable (grey out) a few fields in the table, both of
        these functions are supported in section forms. This function can be access by choosing
        Maintenance-&gt;Data set Section. </p>

      <p>Section forms are separated automatically by data element category combinations, which produce a spreadsheet like data entry form for each section. </p>
      <p>When designing a section form the procedure is as follows:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p> Set up your data set as described in <a class="xref" href="#datasets" title="16.1.&nbsp;Data sets">Section&nbsp;16.1, &#8220;Data sets&#8221;</a></p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Open the Data Set Section window (from right side menu under Data sets) and add your
            sections one by one. To add a new section to a section form, first choose the data set
            from the "Select data set" combo box. Then choose the specific category combo
            and press "Add new". You can now add data elements from the "Available
            data element" list on the left to the "Selected data elements" list on
            the right. Data elements can be sorted within the section with the use of the "Move

            "Move down" <img src="resources/images/dhis2_images/move_down.png"> buttons. Be sure to press

            Click on "Sort section" to sort the order of appearance of your sections in

      <p>A sample section form is displayed in the next figure. Notice how each data element
        category has been separated into a separate section, and a data entry table has been
        automatically generated by the system. Use of section forms in combination with data element
        categories can drastically reduce the amount of time which is required to create data entry
        forms for data sets.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="customDataEntryForm"></a>16.2.3.&nbsp;Custom Forms</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>When the form you want to design is to complicated for the default or section forms then your last option is to use a custom form. This takes more time, but gives you full flexibility in term of the design. DHIS2 uses a built-in HTML editor (FcK Editor) for the form designer and you can either design the form in the UI or paste in your HTML directly (using the Source window in the editor). A complete reference for use of the editor can be found <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Users_Guide" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
      <p>One of the big advantages of custom forms, is that they can be created to mimic existing paper aggregation forms. This makes data entry much easier for users, and should reduce the number of data elements which are incorrectly entered, as they are more easily identifiable when entering data from a paper form. </p>
      <p>Once a custom form has been added to a data set it will be available in data entry and
        used automatically. </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="resources/images/admon/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
        <p>Custom forms are preferentially displayed over section forms. If a data set has both a
          section form and a custom form, the custom form will be displayed during data entry. Users
          will not be able to select which method they wish to input data, so be sure that your
          custom form contains all data elements which may be required.</p>
      </td></tr></table></div>
      <p>To add a custom form design to a data set then first locate your data set in the Data
        set Management window and click on the Design data entry form icon under Operations (the
        fifth icon), see the mouse-over text to be sure.</p>
      <p>First provide a Name for the form. There are a few important buttons in the Editor that you must pay special attention to. The blue monitor icon is the full screen mode on/off button, which can be very useful. The there is a Source button that shows the HTML code for your form. </p>
      <p>If you already have the HTML for your form then you should start by pasting it in here. Click on Source again to go back to preview/non-HTML mode. Then there is an icon in the top right corner with a + sign on it, this will open a list of available data elements to add to your form, the Data Element Selector window. </p>
      <p>All the input fields need to have a link to a data element or indicator. To add new data elements to the form, double-click them from the data element/indicator box as shown below. You can also select a data element/indicator and press the "+Insert" button. You can switch between either data elements or indicators by pressing the respective buttons.</p>

      <p>In custom data entry form you can use javascript to create dynamic behavior and
        customziations. The DHIS 2 data entry module provides a range of events which you can
        register for and use to perform actions at certain times. The events are registered on the
        document element. The jQuery event object and the data set identifier are always the first
        two arguments provided to the callback functions. The table below provides an overview of
        the events and when they are triggered.</p>

      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>To register for such an event:</p>
      <pre class="screen">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.formReady', function( event, ds ) {
  console.log( 'The form with id: ' + ds + ' is loaded!' );
} );

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.dataValueSaved', function( event, ds, dv ) {
  console.log( 'Data value: ' + dv.value + ' was saved with data element: ' + dv.de );
} );

dhis2.util.on( 'dhis2.de.event.completed', function( event, ds, cr ) {
  console.log( 'Form was completed for org unit: ' + cr.ou );
} );

&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
      <p>Be careful to only use "namespaced" events like the ones in the example above and not
        general ones like "click" as the dhis2.util.on method will unregister the event
        first.</p>
      <p>If your function only applies to certain data sets you can use the supplied data set
        identifier and shortcut your function for unwanted data sets like this:</p>
      <pre class="screen">dhis2.de.on( 'dhis2.de.event.validationSuccess', function( event, ds ) {
  if ( $.inArray( ds, ['utXOiGbEj14', 'Re7qzHEThSC'] ) == -1 ) {
    return false;
  }
  console.log( 'Form with id: ' + ds + ' validated successfully!' );
} );</pre>
      <p>The identifiers of the input fields in the data entry form is on the format described
        below. This format can be used to select the input fields in your script and perform actions
        on them:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;dataelementid&gt;-&lt;optioncomboid&gt;-val</pre>
      <p>Since the data set identifier is provided for all events a feasible alternative is to
        utilize the "files" Web API resource and keep your callback functions in a single file,
        where you let the javascript code take action based on which data set is currently
        loaded.</p>

      <p>The data set assignment editor is a tool for adding and removing many data sets to organisation units in batch style. Start by selecting an organisation unit from the selection tree. In the area below the tree a grid will be displayed showing all data sets as columns and the child organisation units as rows.</p>
      <p>From the grid you can now assign or unassign data sets simply by clicking on of the corresponding icons in the grid. If you want to assign or unassign an organisation unit to all data sets you can check or uncheck the checkbox next to the organisation unit. Your changes will automatically be saved.</p>

  <p>DHIS2 allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously, each with a defined set of permissions. These permissions can be finely tuned so that certain users can only enter data, while others may generate reports. Multiple user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users which grant them certain privileges within the system. This chapter describes how to manage users and user roles.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="creating_new_users"></a>17.1.&nbsp;Creating new users and roles</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>This section will describe how to add new users and manage existing users to the DHIS2 application. You can create as many user names as you need. Each user can be assigned certain privileges, and can be assigned to certain organisation units for which they will be enabled to enter data on behalf of. To access the user module, choose <span class="italic">Users</span> from the Apps menu and then click "User" from the menu items on the left-hand pane.</p>

      </div>
      <p>You can search for specific user names in the user list by

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="user_user_roles"></a>17.1.2.&nbsp;User role management</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>As part of creating a user name you are required to define the user
      role. Do so by clicking on <span class="italic">User Role</span> on the left side of
      the displayed screen. This will lead you to the User role management page where you can
      click on <span class="guibutton">Add new</span> to create a new role.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The following screen will open and here in the first text box you
      need to give a <span class="italic">Name</span> of the Role such as Super User,      Admin User, etc. The
      second text box called <span class="italic">Description</span> gives more information about the
      type of User Role that is being created for e.g. State Admin User,
      District Data Entry.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Next you will specify the particular data set(s) that are to be
      made available to the particular role. You will also need to specify the
      type of <span class="italic">Authority</span> to be given to the particular user. For each of the
      three options namely Datasets, Reports and Authorities user can select
      multiple options from the scroll down menu provided against each field.
      A user can choose multiple options either by moving them
      one-by-one.</p>
      <p>In order for particular users to be able to enter data, you must
      add them to both a dataset as well as an organisational unit level. You
      can also select multiple datasets individually by pressing the Ctrl key
      on the keyboard and clicking on individual datasets.</p>
      <p>Finally when you have entered the required fields click on
      <span class="guibutton">Save</span> which is located on the lower part of the
      displayed screen. The desired user role and related authorisation will
      be saved to the database, and can then be assigned to a particular
      user.</p>

      <p>DHIS 2 supports the OpenID standard, which allows third party login using a OpenID
        provider, please see <a class="ulink" href="http://openid.net" target="_top">http://openid.net</a> for more
        information. To create a custom OpenID URL for a username you can visit this URL and log in

  <p>This chapter discusses the sharing of entities feature in DHIS 2.</p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1624"></a>18.1.&nbsp;Sharing of objects</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>A large part of the objects in DHIS 2, like reports, charts, maps and indicators, can be
      shared. Sharing means making an object, like a report, available for reading or modification
      to a group of users or to everyone. For instance for reports, the sharing dialog can be opened
      by clicking on the "Sharing settings" button next to each report in the list.</p> 
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="45%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/sharing/sharing-settings.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>Clicking on the "Sharing settings" button will open the sharing dialog. The sharing dialog is where sharing is controlled.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="40%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/sharing/sharing-dialog.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>You can share your report with everyone or with a number of user groups. Next to "Public
      access" you can choose your public access option: "None", "Can view" or "Can edit and view".
      Edit also implies deleting the report. To share with a group, simply start typing the name of
      the group and the "Search for user groups" input field and select your desired group. Click on
      the "+" icon next to the input field to share with that group. For each group you can set an
      access option, similar to public access.</p>
    <p>Sharing with a user group implies that all users in that group will get access to the
      shared object. To create a user group you can go to the dashboard module and click on "Groups"
      on the front page. This will lead you to the list of groups where you can click "Add new" in
      the top right corner. Creating user groups is open for everyone from the dashboard
      module.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1640"></a>18.2.&nbsp;Sharing and access control</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The objects which support sharing are indicator, indicator group, indicator group set,
      data dictionary, data set, program, standard report, resource, report table, chart, map and
      user group. Out of those objects, report table, chart, map and user group are open for
      everyone to create privately. Private means that the objects are available only to yourself or
      potentially to a number of user groups if you choose to share the object. These objects are
      referred to as "open" objects and can be created by all users. The remaining objects require
      that your user account has the authority to create them. These objects are referred to as
      "non-open" objects.</p>
    <p>A user can be granted the authority to create publicly accessible objects or privately
      accessible objects. In order to create a publicly accessible object (available for viewing or
      editing by anyone) your user account must have the authority to do so. As an example, to
      create a publicly accessible chart, your user must have the "Create public chart" authority
      granted. The authority to create private objects applies only to non-open objects. For
      example, to allow a user to create indicators which will only be accessible to that user and
      not to everyone, the user can be issued with the "Create private indicator" authority.</p>
    <p>Sharing a non-open object with another person and let her edit the object requires that
      the person's user account has the authority for updating that type of objects granted. For
      instance, if you want to let another person edit your indicator, that person's user account
      must have the "Update indicator" authority granted. This does not apply for open
      objects.</p>
    <p>When you create a new object it will automatically become viewable for everyone if your
      user account has the authority to create public objects. As an example, if you create a
      standard report and you have the "Create public standard report" authority granted, the report
      will become viewable for everyone. If you do not have that authority granted the report will
      be viewable only to yourself. After you have created an object, you may navigate to the
      "Sharing settings" dialog and set your desired access control level.</p>
    <p>If you need a user account which is able to view absolutely all objects you can create a
      user role with the "ALL" authority and assign a user to that role. If you need to switch
      between a "complete" view of objects and a "personal" view of objects it is recommended to
      create two user accounts, one assigned with the "ALL" authority and one without.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1647"></a>18.3.&nbsp;Sharing applied</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The sharing functionality is useful in several scenarios. One use-case is setting up a
      DHIS instance for a global organisation with operations in multiple countries. Typically the
      organisation has a set of global data sets, indicators and reports which should apply to all
      countries, while all countries will have the need for country-specific data sets, indicators
      and reports. In this scenario the following approach could work: </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Set up one user group for global personnel.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Set up a user group for personnel in each country.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Create global data sets and reports, make them viewable for everyone and editable for
          the global user group only.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Create country-specific data sets and reports, make them viewable and editable for the
          country user group and the global user group only.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>This way, the global indicators and reports could be viewed and analysed by everyone, but
      maintained by the global user group only. The country-specific data sets, indicators and
      reports could be viewed and maintained by the country and global personnel, without being
      visible or impacting the system for other countries in the organisation.</p>
    <p>A similar approach could work for a scenario with a donor, multiple funding agencies and
      implementing partners in a country, where user groups could be set up for each of those
      entities. That way each implementing partner could create and share their reports within their
      organisation without affecting or allowing access to others. Reports could also be shared with
      supervisors and funding agencies at the end of reporting periods.</p>
    <p>Another use-case is a country department of health with multiple health programs.
      Typically there is a need for having general reports and charts for the department while
      allowing the health programs to develop specific reports and charts for internal use. This can
      be achieved by creating user groups for each health program. Later, when developing reports
      and charts, these can be made viewable and editable to the program user group only. This way
      the reports will not be visible to other programs and users. This is beneficial because the
      reports are kept internal to the program and because the visible list of reports of other
      users are kept shorter and more relevant.</p>

    <p>Data quality can be checked at the point of data entry through setting the minimum and maximum value range for each element manually or generating the min-max values using the DHIS 2 if there is historical data available for that data element.
    </p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1696"></a>19.3.1.&nbsp;Setting the minimum and maximum value range manually </h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>If you are using the default entry screen click on the element for which you want to set the min-max value. A pop-up window will appear in which you can enter the values. On subsequent data entry if the value entered does not fall within the set min-max range the text box will change colour to red. The user will also get a pop-up as shown below. This change in colour is a prompt to check the data entered and make necessary correction. On the data entry screen the users also have the option to add a comment on how the discrepant figure might be explained (if required). This you can do by using the drop down menu of the &#8216;comment&#8217; box. In case you are using the custom data entry screen which is displayed when you deselect the &#8216;default data entry form&#8217; option on the top right corner of the screen. In this case the minimum and maximum values can be added by double-clicking on the data entry box instead of the data element.</p>

      <p>It is possible to generate the min-max value, element-wise, using the DHIS2. In such case you merely need to click on the &#8216;Generate min-max&#8217; button near the upper right corner. In case of default data entry screen the min and max values, when generated, will appear on the left and right side of the data entry box.

    <p>This module provides management of validation rules. A validation rule is based on an expression which defines a relationship between a number of data elements. The expression has a left side and a right side and an operator which defines whether the former must be less than, equal to or greater than the latter. The expression forms a condition which should assert that certain logical criteria are met. For instance, a validation rule could assert that the total number of vaccines given to infants is less than or equal to the total number of infants.</p>
    <p>To add a validation rule, just follow these steps:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Click on the <span class="italic">Add new</span> button</p>

        <p>Provide a descriptive <span class="italic">Name</span> for the validation rule. The name must be unique among the validation rules.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Provide a <span class="italic">Description</span> for the validation rule.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select the <span class="italic">Importance</span> you wish to assign to the validation rule: <span class="italic">high</span>, <span class="italic">medium</span> or <span class="italic">low</span>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select the <span class="italic">Rule type</span>. For validating correct data, choose <span class="italic">Validation</span>. For monitoring  data according to a rule, choose <span class="italic">Surveillance</span> and follow the extra instructions below.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select the <span class="italic">Period type</span> for the data being validated.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select an <span class="italic">Operator</span>. The operator options are <span class="italic">equal</span>, <span class="italic">not equal</span>, <span class="italic">greater than</span>, <span class="italic">greater than or equal</span>, <span class="italic">less than</span>, <span class="italic">less than or equal to</span> and <span class="italic">compulsory pair</span>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Define the <span class="italic">left side</span> and <span class="italic">right side</span> of the validation rule expression. First, provide a description for the expression. Second, build the expression with the expression builder. The expression is mathematical and contain data elements as well as integers and mathematical operators. Data elements can be included by double-clicking one in the available data elements list to the right. Alternatively one can select a data element and click the insert button. Mathematical operators can be included by clicking the corresponding button under the expression builder area.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Save each expression by clicking <span class="italic">Save</span>, then save the validation rule by clicking <span class="italic">Save</span>.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>When editing an expression, check the setting <span class="italic">skip for missing values</span> to require that all data element values in the expression must be present. If any values are missing, the validation rule will be skipped. If this setting is unchecked it means that the expression will be evaluated even if some of the values are missing.</p>
    <p>The compulsory pair operator allows you to require that data values must be entered for a form for both left and right sides of the expression, or for neither side. In other words, you can require that if one field in a form is filled, then one or more other fields must also be filled.</p>
    <p>To edit a validation rule, click the <span class="italic">edit</span>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list. Then follow the same procedures as above.</p>
    <p>To delete a validation rule, click the <span class="italic">delete</span>icon next to the relevant validation rule in the list.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e1757"></a>19.5.&nbsp;Surveillance Rule</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>As well as checking for correct data, you can use a validation rules  to find unexpected data  values when compared with data from previous time periods. This kind of validation rules are called <span class="italic">surveillance</span> rules.</p>
    <p>To add a surveillance rule, follow the steps above for validation rules, choosing a <span class="italic">
        <span class="italic">rule type</span>
      </span> of <span class="italic">Surveillance</span>. This adds the following validation rule options:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Choose an <span class="italic">Organisation unit level</span> for this surveillance rule. If the data you wish to monitor is not entered at this level, it will be aggregated from lower level organisation units  in the organisation unit hierarchy.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter a <span class="italic">Sequential sample count</span>. This is the number of time periods immediately preceding against which you wish to compare the data. For example, if the  period type is <span class="italic">Weekly</span> and this count is 2, the current data will be compared with past  data averaged over each of the 2 previous weeks.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter an <span class="italic">Annual sample count</span>. This is the number of preceding years over which you will compare the data, from  periods at the same time of preceding years. For example if the period type is Weekly and the count is 3, data for a week starting on the first of September will be compared with data averaged over the week containing September 1 in each of the past 3 years.</p>
        <p>The sequential sample count <span class="italic">or</span> annual sample count must be at least 1.</p>
        <p>You may use the sequential and annual sample counts together. For example, say the period type is <span class="italic">Weekly</span>, the sequential count is 2, and the annual count is 3. The data will be compared with the average of the following time periods: the 2 weeks immediately preceding, and for each of the previous 3 years the data at the same time of year, plus the preceding 2 weeks, plus the following 2 weeks. This makes a total of  17 past periods: 2 immediate past periods plus 5 periods for each of the 3 preceding years. Be aware that when you have many past periods like this, evaluating the surveillance rule may take significant time and system resources.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter a number of <span class="italic">High outliers</span> of past data that you wish to exclude from comparison. This is useful if some past periods may have had unusually high data values, and you wish to compare against the average of all but the highest past period values. This gives the number of highest past period values to exclude before the past period values are averaged and compared with the current value.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter a number of <span class="italic">Low outliers</span> of past data that you wish to exclude from comparison. This is like High outliers except that it gives the number of lowest past period values to exclude before the past period values are averaged and compared with the current value.</p>
        <p>You may use the high and low outliers in combination, but the sum of high outliers and low outliers must be less than the total number of past samples as determined by the sequential and annual sample counts. In the example above where there are 17 past periods, the sum of high and low outliers must be 16 or less.</p>
        <p>If data is not found for all the desired past periods, the high and low outliers will be reduced in proportion to the number of periods for which data is found. For example, say we are looking for 17 past periods with high outliers set to 4 and low outliers set to 2. If data is found for only 9 of these past periods, only 2 high outliers will be discarded, and only 1 low outlier will be discarded.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>When a surveillance rule is evaluated, the <span class="italic">left side</span> of the equation is evaluated for the current period, and the <span class="italic">right side</span> is evaluated for each of the past periods. The right side  values for past periods are   averaged, and the average is  compared to the left side value according to the operator. Any high or low outliers are removed before the right-side average is taken.</p>
    <p>A surveillance rule may contain data elements for periods that are longer than the period given for the rule. This is useful, for example, if you want to divide a data element value by the population count, and the population count is entered annually. The data for the longer period type (e.g. population count) must be entered for a period that overlaps with the start of the period being evaluated. For example, if the period being evaluated is the week starting January 6, 2014, the yearly population count must be entered for the year containing January 6 2014. If the data element is from a longer period type than the rule period type, it must have an aggregation operator of average, not sum. In other words, only data elements that don't sum through time (like population count) can be used from longer periods than the rule period.</p>
    <p>For surveillance rules, the <span class="italic">skip for missing</span> option is given an additional meaning when data is being collected and aggregated from lower levels of the organisation unit hierarchy. When this option is selected and the data is present for some descendants at a lower level, but not all descendants at that level, the rule is skipped.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="validationRuleGroup"></a>19.6.&nbsp;Validation Rule Group</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>A validation rule group provides a mechanism for classifying related validation rules. Another advantage of using validation rule groups is that it can later be run separately, instead of running all validation rules.</p>
    <p>You can also use a validation rule group to configure how users are notified of alerts from scheduled validation runs. To do this, you should identify a set of validation rules you want to evaluate regularly, and a group of users who should be notified of any exceptions to these rules. Then:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Be sure that one or more user groups are defined containing all the users you wish to notify.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Define a validation rule group for a set of validation rules. In the section User groups to alert, select one or more user groups to be notified.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>By repeating these two steps, you can build any set of relations between validation rules and users to fit your needs.</p>
    <p>When you create or edit a validation rule group, there is an option called <span class="italic">Only organisation unit related users are alerted</span>. If this is set to <span class="italic">Yes</span>, then each user in the group(s) will be alerted only for validation exceptions for an organisation unit to which the user has been assigned through user management -- or for any lower-level organisation unit under that organisation unit. If this is set to <span class="italic">No</span>, then each user in the assigned user group(s) will be alerted for all validation exceptions in the group, regardless of organisation unit.</p>
    <p>To enable routine scheduling of data validation runs, choose Data Administration from the Maintenance menu. Then click on Scheduling. If scheduling is active, click on the Stop button, then select the Data monitoring strategy of All daily. Finally enable scheduling by clicking on the Start button.</p>

      <p>Indicators are composed of multiple data elements, and typically consist of a numerator
        and denominator. Calculated totals do not have a denominator. Indicators are never entered directly in DHIS2 through data entry, but are derived from combinations of
        data elements and factors. Indicators are used to calculate coverage rates, incidence and
        other values are a result of data element values that have been entered into the system. </p>
      <p>To access the Indicator maintains page, press Maintenance -&gt; Data Element and Indicators  and then pressing "Indicator" from the left pane or the main dialog.  Similar to data elements, you can add, delete, modify and view extra information about the indicators in the system. </p>

          <p>Constants: Constants are numerical values which will remain the same for all

        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Days: A special operator "D" is available in formulas. This operator will
            always provide the number of days for a given indicator calculation. As an example, if
            you wish to calculate the "Percentage of time vaccine refrigerator was
            non-functional", you could define the numerator as ("D-"Number of days
            vaccine refrigerator was available"")/"D". For example, if the
            fridge was available 25 days in June, the indicator would be calculated as
            (30-25/25)*100=17%. If you were however to calculate the total for Quarter 1, the number
            of days ("D") would be equal to 31+28+31=90. Thus, the "D" parameter
            will always be the number of days in the period of interest.</p>

          <p>Org unit group counts: Org unit groups can be utilized in formulas and will be
            substituted by the number of organisation units in the group. During aggregation, the org
            units in the group will be intersected with the part of the org unit hierarchy being
            requested. As an example, this lets you use the number of public facilities in a
            specific district in indicators. This is useful e.g. when creating facility
            infrastructure surveys and reports.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Constants:  Indicators may make use of constants. Constants are static values which will be applied uniformly to the indicator formula. Constants are applied AFTER data element values have been aggregated.</p>

      <p>Indicator types simply define a factor that will be applied during aggregation. Indicator values that are calculate during a data mart export or report table generation process will appear properly formatted, and will therefore not require an additional multiplier (e.g. 100 in the case of percents) for the values to appear correctly formatted. </p>
      <p>The indicator type maintenance panel has all of the same functions (Add new, Edit, Translate, Delete, and Information) as the Indicator maintenance section. </p>
      <p>There are only two fields that need to be filled-in to create an indicator type, Name and Factor, as seen below. Name refers to the Indicator type (e.g. Per cent, Per thousand, Per ten thousand, etc). The factor is the numeric factor that will be multiplied to the indicator formula during the calculation of the indicator. </p>

        <p>As of version 2.4 of DHIS2, the "Calculated data element" object has been deprecated. Instead, a calculated data element can be created by creating an indicator type with a factor of "1" and by setting the "Number" option to "Yes". The effect of setting the "Number" option to "Yes" will be that the indicator will effectively not have a denominator. You will therefore only be able to define a numerator, which will serve as the formula of the calculated data element.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="reporting_intro"></a>21.1.&nbsp;Reporting functionality in DHIS 2</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The reporting module in DHIS 2 provides a range of reporting alternatives, and this section will explain how to use them to view and analyse data. Another section explains how to configure and set up the various reporting tools.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Standard reports:</strong></span> Standard reports are built on report tables, but are more advanced in its design allowing for more cosmetics and styles. These reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made available as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as PDF  files which makes them ideal for printing as well as sharing offline. </p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dataset reports:</strong></span> Dataset reports are simply a printer friendly way to look at the data entry forms with either raw or aggregated data (over time or place). The design used in data entry will be used also in the data set reports. This will work only for data sets that has a custom data entry form set up.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dashboard:</strong></span> The fastest way to view your data. The dashboard can display  up to four updated charts as well as shortcuts to your favourite reports, report tables, and map views. Each user can configure a personal dashboard.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Data Visualizer:</strong></span> Do flexible visualizations of your data
      as charts and data tables. Any number of indicators and data elements can be included. Several
      chart types are available, such as column, stacked column, line, area and pie charts. The
      charts can be saved in order to be easily retrieved later and can also be put on your personal
      dashboard. Charts can be downloaded as image and PDF files to your local computer. </p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Report tables:</strong></span> These are very configurable table outputs
      of your data, either showing raw or aggregated data, as well as indicator data. These tables
      are used as either a data source for more advanced reports, for export to external systems, or
      as a crude report itself, and are exportable to PDF, excel, CSV and jasper design files. These
      tables represent a very dynamic, flexible and quick way to look at the data. Report tables can
      be set up with parameters to make them reusable over time and place.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Orgunit distribution reports:</strong></span> These reports are generated
      off the orgunit group set information and can show what types (and how many of each type) of
      health facilities that are located in a given area (any level in the hierarchy). These reports
      are automatically generated and display the information in both tables and charts, and
      downloads in PDF, excel, and CSV are available.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Reporting rate summary:</strong></span> These reports provide a nice overview of how many facilities that have submitted their data for a given dataset and period. Here you can get both the counts and the percentages  showing the reporting rate for all or single data sets.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Excel pivot tables:</strong></span> Excel pivot tables represents a very powerful way to analyse your data and DHIS 2 links directly to the pivot tables so that all the data will be available and updated in your Excel file. This can be a very useful tool for users that prefer working with the data offline. To update your local pivot tables you need the myDatamart tool which connects to the online server and downloads the latest data. This update will typically take place once a month when new data is available, but do not require a constant internet connection like the other reporting tools (if you are connecting to an online DHIS 2 server).</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Web-based pivot tables:</strong></span> The built in pivot table tool is a simple web-based tool to display indicator data by orgunit and period in a typical pivot table view and allows for some basic pivoting manipulations of the tables. It is a quick and easy way to look at many indicator values at the same time (by orgunit and/or period), but does not have the same functionality as the offline Excel pivot tables. </p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>GIS:</strong></span> Present and analyse your data using thematic maps. You can view both data elements and indicators and given that you have coordinates for all your orgunits you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels from country polygons to facility points.  See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map information is built into DHIS 2 and all you need to do is to register coordinates for your organisation units and the maps will be available.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="standard_reports"></a>21.2.&nbsp;Using standard reports</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>You access the available reports from the Services drop-down menu, by selecting Reports. In the report menu in the left bar, click Standard Report. A list of all pre-defined reports will appear in the main window. </p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="50%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/standard_reports_ke.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>You run/view a report by clicking on the name of the report and then selecting "Create" from the contextual menu. If there are any pre-define paramaters, you will see a report parameter window where you must fill in the values needed for
      orgunit and/or reporting month, depending on what has been defined in the underlying report
      table(s). Click on "Get Report" when you are ready. The report will either appear
      directly in your browser or be available as a PDF file for download, depending on your
      browser settings for handling PDF files. You can save the file and keep it locally on your
      computer for later use. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="report_tables"></a>21.3.&nbsp;Using report tables</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Report tables are a simple-to-use tool for creating tabular analysis. To run a report table first navigate to the list of available report tables in Services-&gt;Reports-&gt;Report Tables and then the name of the report table you wish to use. Select "Create" from the contextual menu. If the report table has any pre-defined paramaters, you will need to select them in the next screen. Finally, press "Get report" to view the report table. </p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Report parameters:</strong></span> Most report tables have parameters, which means that you can filter which orgunits and/or periods you want in the report. This makes the reports much more reusable. When you run the report table a Report parameter window will open and ask the user to input values for the selected parameters. The possible parameters are Reporting Month and Organisation Unit, and either one of these or both will show in the window.    After selecting the values click on the Get Report button.</p>

    </div>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Export/view options:</strong></span> When the report table is ready it
      will be displayed in a HTML view. The report table can be exported to PDF (for better printing
      and easier saving), Excel, CSV, and also to a standard report format (Jasper) with a nicer
      table and a chart shown in PDF, or as a Jasper design file (JRXML) for further improvements and
      changes to the report design before uploading it as a standard report (see the Creating
      standard reports section in the Developers Guide for more detail information).</p>

    <p> You can also share a comment or intepretation about this report table from the report table view, by simply writing a comment in the box and pressing "Share".</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dataset_reports"></a>21.4.&nbsp;Using dataset reports</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Dataset reports are printer friendly views of the data entry screen filled with either raw or aggregated data. These are only available for data sets that have custom data entry forms and not for default or section forms.</p>
    <p>You can access data set reports from the Report menu under Services.</p>
    <p>A Criteria window will appear where you fill in the details for your report:</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dataset:</strong></span> The data set you want to display.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Reporting period: </strong></span>The actual period you want data for. This can be aggregated as well as raw periods. This means that you can ask for a quarterly or annual report even though the data set is collected monthly. A data set's period type (collection frequency) is defined in data set maintenance. First select the period type (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly etc.) in the drop down next to Prev and Next buttons, and then select one of the available periods from the dropdown list below. Use Prev and Next to jump one year back or forward.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use data for selected unit only:</strong></span> Use this option if you want a report for an orgunit that has children, but only want the data collected directly for this unit and not the data collected by its children. If you want a typical aggregated report for an orgunit you do not want to tick this option.</p>
    <p><span class="bold"><strong>Reporting Organisation unit:</strong></span> Here you select the orgunit you want the report for. This can be at any level in the hierarchy as the data will be aggregated up to this level automatically (if you do not tick the option above).</p>
    <p>When you are done filling in the report criteria you click on "Generate". The report will appear in html view in a printer-friendly format. Use print and save as functions in the browser to print or save (as html) the report.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="resource"></a>21.5.&nbsp;Using resources</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The resource tool allows you to upload both files from your local computer to the DHIS
      server and to add links to other resources on the Internet through URLs. If you want to share
      the direct link to the DHIS resource you can right click on the "view resource" button and
      copy the link address.</p>
    <p>The create a resource click on the "Add new" button. Enter a name for the resource, then choose between uploading a file or external URL. If you chose file upload click "Choose file" and select your file your local computer. If you chose URL enter the link to the resource on the Internet. Then click "Save".</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="reporting_reporting_rate_summary"></a>21.6.&nbsp;Using reporting rate summary</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Access the reporting rate summary from the Services-&gt;Reports menu. Reporting rate
      summaries will show how many datasets (forms) that have been submitted by organisation unit
      and period. There are two methods available to calculate reporting rates
      (completeness):</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Based on complete data set registrations. A complete data set registration refers to a
          user marking a data entry form as complete, typically by clicking the complete button in
          the data entry screen, hereby indicating to the system that she considers the form to be
          complete. This is i.e. a subjective approach to calculating completeness.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Based on compulsory data element: You can define any number of data elements in a data
          set to be compulsory. This implies that data values must be captured for all data elements
          which have been marked as compulsory in order for the data set to be considered complete.
          This is i.e. an objective approach to calculating completeness.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>The reporting rate summary will for each row show a range of measures:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>Actual reports: Indicates the number of data entry complete registrations for the

      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Expected reports: Indicates how many data entry complete registrations are expected.
          This number is based on the number of organisation units the relevant data set has been
          assigned to (enabled for data entry).</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Percent: The percentage of reports registered as complete based on the number
          expected.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Reports on time: Same as actual reports, only reports registered as complete within
          the maximum number of days after the end of the reporting period. This number of days

      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Percent on time: Same as percentage, only reports registered as complete on time used
          as numerator.</p>

    <p>The pivot table module enables users to create pivot tables, using all available data
        <span class="italic">dimensions</span> in DHIS 2. A pivot table is a dynamic tool for
      data analysis which lets you quickly summarize and arrange data according to its dimensions.
      Examples of data dimensions in DHIS 2 are data elements (explaining what the data means),
      periods (representing the time aspect) and the organisational hierarchy (representing the
      geographical location of the data). From these dimensions you can freely select dimension
        <span class="italic">items</span> to include in the pivot table.</p>
    <p>A pivot table can arrange data dimensions on <span class="italic">columns</span>,
        <span class="italic">rows</span>, and as <span class="italic">filters</span>.
      When you place a data dimension on columns, the pivot table will display one column per
      dimension item. If you place multiple data dimensions on columns, the pivot table will display
      one column for all combinations of the items in the selected dimensions. When you place a data
      dimension on rows, the pivot table will display one row per dimension item in a similar
      fashion. The dimensions you select as filters will not be included in the pivot table, but
      will aggregate and filter the table data based on the selected filter items.</p>
    <p>The workflow for creating a simple pivot table is:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Select dimension items in the left menu, for instance a few data elements.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Click "Layout" on the top menu and arrange the data dimensions as columns, rows, and
          filters. You can leave the selection as it is if desired.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Click "Update".</p>
      </li></ol></div>
    <p>Based on the demo database, a pivot table approximately as below will be displayed. Notice
      how indicators are listed on columns and periods as rows.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="85%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/pivot_table/basic_pivot.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2063"></a>22.2.&nbsp;Selecting dimension items</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The left menu will list sections for all available data dimensions. From each section you
      can select any number of dimension items. As an example, you can open the section for data
      elements and select any number of data elements from the available list. You can select an
      item by marking it and clicking on the arrow in the section header or simply double-clicking
      on the item. Before you can use a data dimension in your pivot table you must at least select
      one dimension item. If you arrange a dimension as columns or rows but do not select any
      dimension items, the dimension will be ignored.</p>
    <p>For the indicator and data element dimensions you must first select one or all groups from
      the group list. You can then select data elements from the available items list.</p>
    <p>For the period dimension you can choose between using fixed periods or relative periods.
      An example of a fixed period is "January 2012". To select fixed periods start by selecting a
      period type from the period type list. You can then select periods from the list of available
      periods. Relative periods are periods relative to the current date. Examples of relative
      periods are "Last month", "Last 12 months", "Last 5 years". Relative periods can be selected
      by ticking the checkboxes next to each period. The main advantage of using relative periods is
      that when you save a pivot table favorite, it will stay updated with the latest data as time
      goes by without the need for constantly updating it.</p>
    <p>For the organisation unit dimension you can select any number of organisation units from
      the hierarchy. To select all organisation units below a specific parent organisation unit,
      right click and click "Select all children". To manually select multiple organisation units,
      click and hold the Ctrl button while clicking on organisation units. You can tick "User
      organisation unit", "User organisation unit children" or "User organisation unit grand children"
      in order to dynamically insert the organisation unit or units associated with your user account.
      This is useful when you save a pivot table favorite and want to share it with other users, as the
      organisation units linked with the other user's account will be used when viewing the favorite.</p>

    <p>After selecting data dimensions it is time to arrange your pivot table. Click "Layout" in
      the top menu to open the layout screen. In this screen you can position your data dimensions
      as table columns, rows or filters by clicking and dragging the dimensions from the dimensions
      list to the respective column, row and filter lists. You can set any number of dimensions in
      any of the lists. For instance, you can click on "Organisation units" and drag it to the row
      list in order to position the organisation unit dimension as table rows.  Note that
      indicators, data elements and data set reporting rates are part of the common "Data" dimension
      and will be displayed together in the pivot table. For instance, after selecting indicators
      and data elements in the left menu, you can drag "Data" from the available dimensions list to
      the row dimension list in order to arrange them as rows in the pivot table.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="45%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/pivot_table/table_layout.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div>
    <p>After you have set up your pivot table you can click "Update" to render your pivot table,
      or click "Hide" to hide the layout screen without any changes taking effect. Since we in our
      example have selected both the period and organisation unit dimension as rows, the pivot table
      will generate all combinations of the items in these dimensions and produce a table like
      this:</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
      
      <div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="90%"><tr><td><img src="resources/images/pivot_table/pivot_rows.png" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>

    <p>Several table options are available when working with a pivot table. Open the options
      screen by clicking on "Options" in the top menu. The following options are available:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
	    <p>Show totals: Display total values in the table for each row and column, as well as a 
	      grand total for all values in the table.</p>
	  </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Show sub-totals: Display subtotals in the table for each dimension. In the screenshot
          above, notice how subtotals are generated for each of the periods in the period dimension.
          Note that subtotals will be hidden for columns or rows if there is only one selected
          dimension, as the values in that case are equal to the subtotals.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Hide empty rows: Hides empty rows from the table, which is useful when looking at
          large tables where a big part of the dimension items do not have data in order to keep the
          table more readable.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Show hierarchy: Shows the name of all ancestors for organisation units, e.g.
		  "Sierra Leone / Bombali / Tamabaka / Sanya CHP" for Sanya CHP. The organisation units are then
		  sorted alphabetically which will order the organisation units perfectly according to the hierarchy.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Display density: Controls the size of the cells in the table. Can be set to
          "comfortable", "normal" and "compact". The "compact" option is handy in order to fit large
          tables into the browser screen.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Font size: Controls the size of the table text font. Can be set to "large", "normal"
          and "small".</p>

    <p>When you have set up a pivot table it is convenient to save it as a favorite. To do so, click
      "Favorites" on the top menu, click "Add new", give the favorite a descriptive name and click "Create".
      You can search for favorites through the search input field at the top. To load an existing favorite,
      simply click the name of the favorite in the list.</p>
    <p>To rename a favorite, click the grey "Rename" icon next to the favorite in the list, change the name
      and click "Update". To overwrite an existing favorite with the current pivot table, click the green
      "Overwrite" icon. To share a favorite with everyone or a user group, click the blue "Share" icon. To
      delete a favorite, click the red "Delete" icon.</p>

    <p>The analysis apps in DHIS 2 are completely integrated, so you can easily switch
	  between pivot table, chart and map visualization of your data. When you have made a pivot table
	  you can click e.g. "Chart" in the top right corner and then select "Open this table as chart".</p>

    </div>    
    <p>If you just want to visualize a small part of your pivot table as a chart, you can click directly on a
    value in the table instead. A menu will appear. If you mouse hover the "Open selection as chart" option you can see

    <p>You can download the data in the current pivot table by clicking on "Download" in the top
      menu. The data can be downloaded in MS Excel and CSV format. The data table will have one
      column per dimension and contain names of the dimension items. You can easily create a pivot
      table in Microsoft Excel from the downloaded Excel file by clicking on "pivot table" in the
      top panel, then clicking on "create pivot table", then marking the data range in the
      spreadsheet before clicking "OK".</p>
    <p>Data can also be downloaded in JSON and XML format. The data format is specified in the
      Web API chapter under the "Analytics" section. The data document will use identifiers of the
      dimension items and will be opened in a new browser window in order to reveal the URL of the
      request to the Web API in the address bar. This will be useful for developers of apps and 
      other client modules based on the DHIS 2 Web API.</p>

    <p>For certain analysis-related resources in DHIS, like pivot tables, charts and maps, one can
      share a data interpretation. An interpretation is simply a link to the relevant resource
      together with a text expressing some insight about the data. If you want to share a pivot table
      interpretation you need to first save the table you want to share as a favorite. Then, without
      making any changes to the table, click the "Share" button the toolbar. A window will
      open up and this is where you write your interpretation. When you are done, click share button
      in the bottom right corner of the window. The window will close automatically and if the
      interpretation was shared successfully you will find a notification on the bottom

  <p>DHIS 2 has an optional feature that allows authorized users to approve data that has been entered. It allows data to be reviewed and approved at selected levels in the organisation unit hierarchy, so the approval follows the structure of the hierarchy from lower levels to higher levels.</p>
  <p>Data is approved for a combination of (a) data set, (b) period and (c) organisation unit. Data may be approved for the organisation unit for which it is entered, as well as for higher-level organisation units to which the data is aggregated. As part of system settings, you can choose the organisation unit level(s) at which data is approved. It can be approved at higher levels only after it has been approved for all that organisation unit's descendants at lower levels for the same data set and period.</p>
  <p>After a data set, period and organisation unit combination has been approved, the form will
    be locked and any further data entry or modification will be prohibited, unless it is later
    un-approved.</p>
  <p>For example, the following diagram illustrates that data has already been approved for organisation units C and D, for a given data set and period. It may now be approved for organisation unit B for the same data set and period. But it is not ready to be approved for organization unit A. Before it can be approved for organisation unit A, it must be approved for B, and for any other children of organisation unit A, for that data set and period.</p>
  <div class="figure"><a name="d5e2159"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;23.1.&nbsp;Approving at organisation units</b></p><div class="figure-contents">

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2164"></a>23.1.&nbsp;Approving and accepting</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>DHIS2 supports two different types of approval processes: either a one-step process where the data is approved at each level, or a two-step process where data is first approved and then accepted at each level. This is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>
    <div class="figure"><a name="d5e2167"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;23.2.&nbsp;Approving and accepting</b></p><div class="figure-contents">
      
      <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="300"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/approval_level_steps.png" align="middle" width="300" alt="Approving and accepting"></td></tr></table></div>
    </div></div><br class="figure-break">
    <p>In the one-step process, data is approved at one level, and then approved at the next higher level. Until it is approved at the next higher level, it may be unapproved at the first level. (For example, if the data was approved my mistake, this allows the  approver to undo their mistake.) Once the data is approved at the next higher level, it may not be unapproved at the lower level unless it is first unapproved at the higher level. </p>
    <p>In the two-step process, data is approved at one level, and then the approval is accepted at the same level. This acceptance is done by a user who is authorized to approve data at the next higher level. Once the data is accepted, it may not be changed or unapproved  unless it is first <span class="italic">unaccepted</span>.</p>
    <p>The two-step process is not required by DHIS2. It is an optional step for a user reviewing data at the next higher level. It has the benefit of locking the acceptance from the level below, so reviewer does not have to worry that the data could be changing from below while it is being reviewed. It can also be used by the higher-level user to keep track of which lower-level data has already been reviewed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2176"></a>23.2.&nbsp;Authorities for approving data</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>To approve data, you must be assigned a role containing one of these  authorities:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approve data</strong></span> - You may approve data for the organisation unit(s) to which you are assigned. Note that this authority does not allow you to approve data for lower-levels below the organisation unit(s) to which you are assigned. This is useful to separate the users authorized to approve at one level from the users authorized to approve at levels below.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approve data at lower levels</strong></span> - Allows you to approve data for all lower levels below the organisation units assigned to you. This is useful if, for example, you are a district-level user whose role includes approving the data for all the facilities within that district, but not for the district itself. If you are assigned this as well as the <span class="italic">Approve data</span> authority, you may approve data at the level of the organisation unit(s) to which you have been assigned, and for any level below.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Accept data at lower levels</strong></span> - Allows you to accept data  for the level just below the organisation unit(s) assigned to you. This authority can be given to the same users as approve data. Or it may be given to different users, if you want to have some users who accept data from the level below, and a different set of users who approve data to go up to the next level above.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
  </div>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2190"></a>23.3.&nbsp;Configure approving data</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>When you add or edit a data set, you specify whether or not data entered for that data set
      will be available for approval. This is done with the <span class="italic">Approve data</span> option when adding or editing a data set.</p>
    <p>You can configure the organisation unit levels at which you want to approve data in these data sets. This is done in the <span class="italic">Settings</span> section, under <span class="italic">System Approval Settings</span>. Click the Add new button on this page and select the organisation unit level at which you want approvals. It will be added to the list of approval settings. You may configure the system for approving data at every organisation unit level, or only at selected organisation unit levels.</p>
    <p>Note that when you add a new approval level, you may optionally choose a Category option group set. This feature is discussed later in this chapter.</p>
    <p>On the <span class="italic">System Approval Settings</span> page, you may select the option <span class="italic">Hide unapproved data in analytics</span> to hide unapproved data in reports, pivot table, data visualizer and GIS. If this option is checked, unapproved data will be hidden from users assigned to higher-level organisation units than where approval is needed. Users who are assigned to organisation units where data is ready for approval can still view the data, as can users assigned to higher-level organisation units if they have the <span class="italic">Approve data at lower levels</span> authority. If this option is not checked, then all data is shown whether approved or not.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e2202"></a>23.4.&nbsp;Approving data</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>To approve data, go to <span class="italic">Reports</span> and choose <span class="italic">Data Approval</span>. When this report shows data that is configured for approval, it shows the approval status of the data in the report. The approval status will be one of the following:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Waiting for lower level org units to approve</strong></span> - This data is not yet ready to be approved, because it first needs to be approved for all the child organisation units to this organisation unit, for the same data set and period.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Ready for approval</strong></span> - This data may now be approved by an authorized user.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">

      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approved and accepted</strong></span> - This data has already been approved, and also accepted.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>If the data you are viewing is in an approval state that can be acted upon, and if you have sufficient authority, one or more of the following actions will be available to you on the <span class="italic">Data Approval</span> form:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Approve</strong></span> - Approve data that has not yet been approved, or that was formerly approved and has been unapproved.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">

        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Unaccept</strong></span> - Return to an unaccepted (but still approved) state data that has been accepted.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>In order to unapprove data for a given organisation unit, you must have the authority to approve data for that organisation unit or to approve data for a higher-level organisation unit to which that data is aggregated. The reason for this is as follows: If you are reviewing data for approval at a higher organisation unit level, you should consider whether the data at lower organisation units are reasonable. If all lower-level data looks good, you can approve the data at the higher level. If some lower-level data looks suspect, you can unapprove the data at the lower level. This allows the data to be reviewed again at the lower level, corrected if necessary, and re-approved up through the organisation unit levels according to the hierarchy.</p>

    <p>When defining an approval level, you specify the organisation unit level at which data will be approved. You may also optionally specify a category option group set. This is useful if you are using  category option groups to define additional dimensions of your data, and you want approvals to be based on these dimensions. The following examples illustrate how this can be done within a single category option group set, and by using multiple category option group sets.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2239"></a>23.5.1.&nbsp;Approving by one category option group set</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>For example, suppose you define a category option group set to represent NGOs who serve as healthcare partners at one or more organisation units. Each category option group within this set represents a different partner. The category option group for Partner 1 may group together category options (such as funding account codes) that are used by that partner as a dimension of the data. So data entered by Partner 1 is attributed to a category option in Partner 1's category option group. Whereas data entered by partner 2 is attributed to a category option in Partner 2's category option group:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e2242"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;23.1.&nbsp;Example Category Option Groups</b></p><div class="table-contents">

      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>Each partner could enter data for their accounts independently of the other, for the same or different data sets, at the same or different facilities. So for example, data can be entered and/or aggregated at the following levels for each partner, independently of each other:</p>

        <p>You can use the sharing feature on category options and category option groups to insure that a user can enter data (and/or see data) only for  certain category options and groups. If you don't want users to see data that is aggregated beyond of their assigned category options and/or category option groups, you can  assign <span class="italic">Selected dimension restrictions for data analysis</span>,  when adding or updating a user.</p>
      </td></tr></table></div>
      <p>You can optionally define approval levels for partner data within any or all of these organisation unit levels. For example, you could define any or all of the following approval levels:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e2269"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;23.2.&nbsp;Example Category Option Group Set approval levels</b></p><div class="table-contents">

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2290"></a>23.5.2.&nbsp;Approving by multiple category option group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>You can also define approval levels for different category option group sets. To continue the example, suppose that you have various agencies that manage the funding to the different partners. For example, Agency A  funds accounts 1A and 2A, while Agency B  funds accounts 1B and 2B. You could set up category option groups for Agency A, and Agency B, and make them both part of a category option group set called Agency. So you would have:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e2293"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;23.3.&nbsp;Example Multiple Category Option Group Sets</b></p><div class="table-contents">

      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>Now suppose that at the country level, you want each partner to approve the data entered by that partner. Once this approval is done, you want each agency to then approve the data from accounts that are managed by that agency. Finally, you want to approve data at the country level across all agencies. You could do this by defining the following approval levels:</p>
      <div class="table"><a name="d5e2319"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;23.4.&nbsp;Example Multiple Category Option Group Set approval levels</b></p><div class="table-contents">
        
        <table summary="Example Multiple Category Option Group Set approval levels" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Approval level</th><th>Organisation unit level</th><th>Category option group set</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Country</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Country</td><td>Agency</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Country</td><td>Partner</td></tr></tbody></table>
      </div></div><br class="table-break">
      <p>Note that multiple approval levels can be defined  for the same organisation unit level. In our example, Partner 1 would approve country-wide data at approval level 3 from category options Account 1A and Account 1B. Next, Agency A would approve country-wide data at approval level 2 from category options Account 1A (after approval by Partner 1) and Account 2A (after approval by Partner 2.) Finally, after approval from all agencies, country-wide data can be approved at approval level 1 across all category options. Note that approval level 1 does not specify a category option group set, meaning that it is for approving data across all category options.</p>
      <p>This example is meant to be illustrative only. You may define as many category option groups as you need, and  as many approval levels as you need at the same organisation unit level for different category option group sets.</p>
      <p>If you have multiple approval levels for different category option group sets at the same organisation unit level, you may change the approval ordering in the <span class="italic">Settings</span> section, under <span class="italic">System Approval Settings</span>. Just click on the approval level you wish to move, and select <span class="italic">Move up</span> or <span class="italic">Move down</span>. If you have an approval level with no category option groups set, it must be the highest approval level for that organisation unit level.</p>

  <p>In a primary health system, the HMIS typically involves a distributed application, where the
    same application is running in different geographical locations (PHCs,CHCs, hospitals,
    districts, and state). Most of these physical locations do not have Internet connectivity, and
    hence they work off-line. At some point (normally at the district level), the data needs to be
    synchronised in order to have a consolidated database for the a particular geographical region.
    For this, it is important to be able to export data from one location (which is working offline,
    say at the health facility level) to another one say at the district level where the data would
    need to be imported. This feature of exporting and importing is thus a crucial function of a
    HMIS. This feature also helps us overcome the dependency on Internet to some degree, as data
    updates can be transferred via USB key where there is no connectivity, or through email where
    there is limited Internet connectivity. DHIS 2 provides robust export-import functionality to
    fulfill these needs. </p>

            existing ones. New only will only accept fresh meta-data, usually you would use this on a
            empty database. Updates only will only allow the meta-data to match meta-data that is

          an object with ID "aaaU6Kr7Gtpidn", which means that an object with this ID was not
          present in your imported file, and it could not be found in the existing database. Its
          important to note that even if a reference could not be found, the object will still be
          imported, but you might have to fix this directly in DHIS 2 later, if the reference should
          have pointed to something else.</p>

        <p>The DXF2 format currently support matching for two identifiers, the internal DHIS2 identifier (known as a UID), and also using an  external identifier called called a "code". When the importer is trying to search for
        references (like the one above), it will first go to the UID field, and then to the code
        field. This allows you to import from legacy systems without having a UID for every meta-data
        object. I.e. if you are importing facility data from a legacy system, you can leave out the
        ID field completely (DHIS 2 will fill this in for you) and the put the legacy systems own
        identifiers in the code field, this identifier is required to be unique. This not only works
        for organisation units, but for all kinds of meta-data, allowing for easy import from other
        systems.</p>

Once you have prepared your GML file as detailed in the chapter on "Importing coordinates", you can load the file with this function. </p>
      <p>It is currently not possible to import an organisation unit hierarchy with GML.

    <p>The import option allows different instance of DHIS 2 to receive standardised sets of data in the absence of a networked system. The functionality can also be used to import data produced by another system (perhaps on a regular basis) or to import legacy data which has been transformed into a format which DHIS2 can understand. Typically, a data set is exported from one DHIS2 instance (e.g. a district level system) to another system (e.g. a provincial level system).  DHIS 2 is also capable of importing data directly from a DHIS 1.4 Access database. Each of these options will be discussed in the following sections. </p>

      <p>It is critical that all data integrity violations which are present in the DHIS 1.4
        database be fully resolved before attempting an import into DHIS2. You can check the data
        integrity of DHIS 1.4 through the CORE Module-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Data integrity checks. A
        report will be generated of all data integrity violations which should be resolved prior to
        importing into DHIS2.</p>

        <p><span class="bold"><strong>DHIS 1.4 File Configuration</strong></span> </p>
        <p>Before you can start the 1.4 file import you need to provide a  few details about the 1.4 database:</p>
        <p><span class="italic">Datafile(#):</span> Here you put the full path to the DHIS 1.4 data file you want to import from, e.g. C:\DHIS14\DHIS_#LR_LIBERIA.mdb. </p>

        <p>Click "Save" and you will return to the DHIS 1.4 File Import window. </p>
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Import Type:</strong></span></p>
        <p>As with other imports you have the options to Import (directly), Preview, or Analyse the import. We recommend using the Analyse option first to check that the 1.4 database is OK and ready to be imported. </p>
        <p>When importing a large database into a new blank DHIS 2 database we recommend using the Import option to save time. </p>
        <p>For smaller incremental imports the Preview is OK.</p>
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Last Updated:</strong></span> </p>
        <p>If you want the full import, all the data in the 1.4 database you leave this field blank.</p>
        <p>If you only want to do an incremental import into an already existing DHIS 2 database you can use this field to filter which data values to import. Only values added or edited after the date you specify will be imported. This filter makes use of the LastUpdated column in the RoutineData table in the DHIS 1.4 data file.</p>
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Import process:</strong></span></p>
        <p>When you are done selecting Method, and LastUpdated you can begin the import by
          clicking on the Import button. This process might take a long time, depending on how many
          data values you are importing. On a reasonable spec. computer the import takes about 2

        <p>Although it is possible to import and export data between instances of DHIS 1.4 and
          DHIS 2, there are significant limitations. Currently, the import of some metadata is not
          supported from DHIS 1.4 to DHIS 2. This includes:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p>Organisational unit alternate names</p>

          </li></ul></div>
        <p>It is also important that the aggregation operator defined in DHIS 1.4 be set to the correct value. Some data, such as population, should have their aggregation operator set to "Average" in DHIS2, as this controls how the aggregation of data is handled over time (but not within the organisational unit hierarchy). </p>

    <p>DHIS2 makes it possible to export various types of data in multiple data formats. You can
      export your data, also referred to as measures or facts; and your meta-data, which refers to
      the information describing your data. Data can be exported both in raw, non-aggregated format
      and in aggregated format. It is also possible to export a combination of data and meta-data in
      case you have special requirements. This chapter covers mainly how to export data and
      meta-data through the user interface of the import-export DHIS 2 module. Data can also be
      exported programmatically through the DHIS 2 Web API, and it is useful to be aware of the
      various options available:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

          chapter, section on meta data.</p>

    <p>Data can be exported on various formats, including DXF 2 (the DHIS 2 meta-data and data
      exchange format based on XML), CSV, PDF, MS Excel and the DHIS 1.4 XML format. </p>
    <p>Another aspect of data export is the type of DHIS 2 deployment. In the case of online
      deployment, all data is saved into a single database only. In an offline deployment, each
      instance will store data in a separate database in their local system. In an offline
      deployment, after the data entry is finished, data will have to be manually sent to the next
      level in the organizational hierarchy. In an on-line application this is not required, as all
      data is captured over an Internet connection and stored in a central location.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e2910"></a>24.3.1.&nbsp;Metadata export</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Meta-data is "data about data". In the context of DHIS 2, meta-data consists
          of definitions of data elements, indicators, the structure and names contained in the
          organizational hierarchy, and other options. Click on the "Meta-data export" link
          from the main "Data export" screen in order to access this. Just select the
          features, format, and the compression that you want and click "Export". This
          metadata file can then be transmitted just like a data file, except it will contain
          information on the definitions of the various features, as opposed to the values of the
          data themselves. </p>

  <p>The data administration module provides a range of functions to ensure that the data stored in the DHIS2 database is integral and that the database performance is optimised. These functions should be executed on a regular basis by a data administrator to ensure that the quality of the data stored is optimal. </p>
  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dataBrowser"></a>25.1.&nbsp;Data browser</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The data browser maintenance and analysis module which allows the user to produce a summary of the data contained in the DHIS2 database. The summary view provides a count of data elements which have been entered at the selected organisation unit as well as its descendants. Raw data for all data elements for a range of time periods and a given organisational unit can be browsed and exported to Excel, CSV, or PDF formats. There are four modes of the data browser, which determine how the data is summarized</p>

    <p>Each of these options can be accessed by selecting the desired option from  <span class="guilabel">"Browse by" </span>drop-down menu. </p>
    <p>In order to produce a summary of submitted data for a given period and grouped by data sets, the user should follow this procedure. Begin by selecting a given periodicity type (e.g. Weekly, monthly, yearly, etc) and then a "From date" and "To date". (e.g. January 2009 to March 2009). Select the type of summary to be produced (e.g. Dataset) from the "Browse by" drop-down menu. Click the "Browse" button to view the summary. </p>

    <p>DHIS2 can perform a wide range of data integrity checks on the data contained in the database. Identifying and correcting data integrity issues is extremely important for ensuring that the data used for analysis purposes is valid. Each of the data integrity checks that are performed by the system will be described, along with general procedures that can be performed to resolve these issues. </p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3041"></a>25.2.1.&nbsp;Data elements without data set</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Each data element must be assigned to a data set. Values for data elements will not be able to be entered into the system if a data element is not assigned to a data set. Choose Maintenance-&gt;Datasets-&gt;Edit from the main menu and then add the "orphaned" data element to the appropriate data set. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3044"></a>25.2.2.&nbsp;Data elements without groups</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Some Data Elements have been allocated to several Data Element Groups. This is currently not allowed, because it will result in duplication of linked data records in the PivotSource recordsets that `feed` the pivot tables. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data Element Groups to review each Data Element identified and remove the incorrect Group allocations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3047"></a>25.2.3.&nbsp;Data elements violating exclusive group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
      Some data elements have been allocated to several data element groups that are members of the same data element group set. All group sets in DHIS are defined as exclusive, which means that a data element can <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> be allocated to <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> data element group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Data element groups to review each data element identified in the integrity check. Either remove the data element from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3052"></a>25.2.4.&nbsp;Data elements assigned to data sets with different period types</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Data Elements should not be assigned to two separate data sets whose period types differ. The recommended approach would be to create two separate data elements (for instance a monthly and yearly data element) and assign these to respective datasets. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3055"></a>25.2.5.&nbsp;Data sets not assigned to organisation units</h3></div></div></div>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3058"></a>25.2.6.&nbsp;Indicators with identical formulas</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Although this rule will not affect data quality, it generally does not make sense to have two indicators with the exact same definition. Review the identified indicators and their formulas and delete or modify  any indicator that appears to be the duplicate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3061"></a>25.2.7.&nbsp;Indicators without groups</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>All Data Elements and Indicators must be assigned to at least one group, so these Indicators need to be allocated to their correct Data Element and Indicator Group. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Indicator Groups, and allocate each of the `Orphaned` Indicators to its correct group.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3070"></a>25.2.10.&nbsp;Indicators violating exclusive group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
      Some indicators have been allocated to several indicator groups that are members of the same indicator group set. All group sets in DHIS are defined as exclusive, which means that an indicator can <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> be allocated to <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> indicator group within that group set. Go to Maintenance -&gt; Data elements and indicators -&gt;Indicator groups to review each indicator identified in the integrity check. Either remove the indicator from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to, or see if one of the groups should be placed in a different group set.

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3081"></a>25.2.13.&nbsp;Organisation units without groups</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>All organisation units <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be allocated to at least <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> group. The problem might either be that you have not defined any `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Set at all, or that there are violations of the `compulsory` rule for some OrgUnits . NOTE: If you have defined no `compulsory` OrgUnit Group Sets, then you must first define them by going to  Maintenance -&gt; Organisation units-&gt;Organisation unit group sets and define at least one `compulsory` Group Set (the group set `OrgUnitType` are nearly universally relevant). If you have the relevant group sets, go to Maintenance -&gt; OrgUnit Groups to review each OrgUnit identified and add the relevant Group allocation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3086"></a>25.2.14.&nbsp;Organisation units violating compulsory group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>These organisation units have not been assigned to the any organisation unit group within one of the  <span class="emphasis"><em>compulsory</em></span> organisation unit group sets. When a group set is defined as `compulsory`, it means that an organisation unit must be allocated to at least one organisation unit group within that group set. For instance, all organisation units must belong to one of the groups in the `organisation unitType` group set. It might belong to  the `Hospital` or the `Clinic` or any other `type` group - but it must belong to exactly one of them.  Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Allocate all organisation units to exactly one group. </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3090"></a>25.2.15.&nbsp;Organisation units violating exclusive group sets</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Some organisation units have been allocated to several organisation unit groups that are members of the same organisation unit group set. All group sets in DHIS are defined as exclusive, which means that an organisation unit can <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> be allocated to <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> organisation unit group within that Group Set. For instance, one organisation unit cannot normally belong to the both the 'Hospital' and 'Clinic' groups , but rather to only to one of them. Go to Maintenance -&gt; organisation unit-&gt;Organisation unit groups to review each organisation unit identified in the integrity check. Remove the organisation unit from all groups except the one that it should be allocated to.</p>

    <p>Resource tables are supporting tables that are used during analysis of data. One would
      typically join the contents of these tables with the data value table when doing queries from
      third-party applications like Microsoft Excel. They are also used extensively by the analysis modules of DHIS2. Regeneration of the resource tables should
      only be done once all data integrity issues are resolved. The resource tables are also generated automatically, every time the analytics process is run by the system. </p>

    <p>It is posible to create custom locales in DHIS2. In addition to the locales available through the system, you might want to add a custom locale such as "English" and "Zambia" to the system. This would allow you to translate metadata objects to local languages, or to account for slight variants between countries which use a common metadata definition. </p>

    <p>The SQL View functionality of DHIS2 will store the SQL view definition internally, and then materialize the view when requested. </p>
    <p>Database administrators must be careful about creating database views directly in the DHIS
      2 database. For instance, when the resource tables are generated, all of them will first be
      dropped and then re-created. If any SQL views depend on these tables, an integrity violation
      exception will be thrown and the process will be aborted.</p>
    <p>The SQL views are dropped in reverse alphabetical order based on their names in DHIS 2,
      and created in regular alphabetical order. This allows you to have dependencies between SQL
      views, given that views only depend on other views which come earlier in the alphabetical
      order. For instance, "ViewB" can safely depend on "ViewA". Otherwise, having views depending
      on other view result in an integrity violation error.</p>

    <p>DHIS 2 provides a feature for synchronizing data being captured on the local instance with
      a another, remote instance of DHIS 2. This can be useful e.g. when you have deployed multiple
      stand-alone instances of DHIS 2 which are required to submit data values to a central DHIS 2
      instance.</p>
    <p>These are the steps to enable data synchronziation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

          <p>The local DHIS 2 instance will store the password of the user account on the remote

            configuration parameter in hibernate.properties to a strong password.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Deploying the remote server on SSL/HTTPS is strongly recommended as the username and

    <p>A data value in DHIS2 (core module for aggregated data) is at minimum described by three dimensions, 1) data element, 2) organisation unit, and 3) period, which also forms the core building blocks of the data model. E.g. if you want to know how many children that were immunised for measles in Gerehun CHC in December 2009, the three dimensions to that value are the Data Element "Measles doses given", the Organisation Unit "Gerehun CHC", and the Period "Dec-09". All data values have at least these three dimensions describing What, Where and When.</p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3420"></a>27.2.1.&nbsp;Data element categories</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The data element above called "Measles doses given", although capturing the core essence of what the data is can be further elaborated and disaggregated into what is called data element categories. The system administrators of DHIS are free to define any data element category dimensions to data elements using the user interface for this in the data element maintenance section, but here are some examples of possible categories to use.</p>
      <p>Given the example of Measles vaccination, if you want to know whether these vaccines were given at the facility (fixed) or out in the community as part of the outreach services then you could add a dimension called e.g. "Place of service" with the two possible options "Fixed" and "Outreach". Then all data collected on measles immunisation would have to be disaggregated along these to options. In addition to this you might be interested in knowing how many of these children who were under 1 year or  above 1 year of age. If so you can add an Age dimension to the data element with the two possible options "&lt;1 y" and "&gt;1 y". This implies further detail on the data collection process. You can also apply both categories Place of service and Age and combine these into a data element category combination e.g. called "EPI disaggregation"  and thereby you would be able to look at 4 different more detailed values in stead of only 1 as in the example above for the data element "Measles doses given": 1) "Fixed and &lt;1 y, 2) Fixed and &gt;1 y, 3) Outreach and &lt;1 y, and 4) Outreach and &gt;1 y. This adds complexity to how data is collected by the health facilities, but at the same time opens up for new possibilities of detailed data analysis of Measles immunisation.</p>

      <p>While the data element categories and their options described above dictated the level of detail (disaggregation) at the point of data collection and how data values get stored in the database, the data element group sets and groups can be used to add more information to data elements after data collection. E.g. if looking at a lot of data elements at the same time in a report you would want to group these based on some criteria, e.g. if looking at all the data captured in a form for immunisation and nutrition you might want to separate or group data elements along a programme dimension (called group set) where "Immunisation" (or EPI) and "Nutrition" would be the two groups. Expanding the report to include data from other programs or larger themes of health data would mean more groups to such a group set dimension, like "Malaria", "Reproductive Health", "Stocks". For this example you would create a data element group set called "Programme" (or whatever name you find appropriate), and to represent the different programmes in this dimension  you would define data elements groups called "EPI", "Nutrition", "Malaria", "Reproductive health" and so on, and add all these groups to the "Programme" group set. To link or tag the data element "Measles doses given" to such a dimension you must (in our example) add it to the "EPI" group. Which groups you add "Measles doses given" to does not affect how health facilities collect the data, but adds more possibilities to your data analysis. So for the group set dimensions there are three levels; the group set (e.g. "Programme"), the group (e.g. "EPI"), and the data element (e.g. "Measles doses given").</p>
      <p>Indicators can be grouped into indicator groups and further into indicator group sets (dimensions) in exactly the same way as data elements.</p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3556"></a>27.3.&nbsp;The organisation unit dimension</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>Organisation units in DHIS2 can be either any type of health facility like Community Health Centres or referral hospitals, or an administrative unit like "MoHS Sierra Leone", "Bo District" or "Baoma Chiefdom". Orgunits are represented in a default hierarchy following the health system at large, and are therefore assigned an organisational level. E.g. Sierra Leone has 4 levels; National, District, Chiefdom, and PHU, and all orgunits are linked to one of these levels. An orgunit hierarchy in DHIS can have any number of levels. Normally data is collected at the lowest level, at the PHUs, and then data values are linked to individual PHUs.  When designing reports at higher levels with data aggregated by chiefdom or district, the DHIS will use the hierarchy structure to sum up all the health facilities' data for any given unit at any level. The orgunit level capturing the data always represents the lowest level of detail that is possible to use in data analysis, and the organisational levels define the available levels of aggregation along a geographical dimension.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3559"></a>27.3.1.&nbsp;Organisation unit group sets and groups</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>While PHU is the lowest geographical level for disaggregation in DHIS2 there are ways to flexibly group organisation units into any number of dimensions by using the group sets and groups functionality. E.g. if all PHUs are given an official type like CHC, CHP, MCHP etc. it is possible to create an orgunit group set called "Orgunit type" and add groups with the names of the  types mentioned above. Then you can link your orgunits to their corresponding groups (orgunit types). Other common orgunit dimensions are Rural/Urban (Rural, Urbal, Peri-urban), and Ownership (Public, Private. NGO etc.). When analysing data from the PHU level it then becomes possible to aggregate data by these dimensions, e.g. look at Measles immunisation in BO district by the type of PHU in stead of the PHUs themselves.</p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e3562"></a>27.3.1.1.&nbsp;Alternative orgunit hierarchies - advanced use of group sets and groups</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>A more advanced use of orgunit group sets and groups is to create alternative hierarchies e.g. use administrative borders from other ministries. In Sierra Leone that could mean an alternative hierarchy of 1:MoHS, 2:Districts, and 3: Local councils,  instead of the 4 level hierarchy with  chiefdoms and PHUs. E.g. if all PHUs where linked to a specific local council it would be possible to look at data aggregated by local council instead of chiefdom. Then you would first need to create a group set called "Local council" and then create one orgunit group for every local council, and finally link all PHUs to their corresponding local council group.</p>

      <p>Groups that are not members of group sets are more or less useless for analysis (should we allow this at all?). With all the groups you get by e.g. including all different diagnoses as groups the full list of groups does not makes sense in any pivot table, and you easily get duplicates in your pivot tables since data elements or indicators are members of multiple groups. This can be controlled by the use of group sets. So the recommodation is to assign all your groups to a group set, and then you pull the group sets you need into your reports and analysis. </p>
      <p>It is also recommended to have one group set that is used for the major organising of
        all data in e.g. a pivot table, e.g. use health programs or other larger themes for data
        elements or indicators that together cover all the data. That will provide a nicely
        organised overview of all your raw data or indicator data.</p>
      <p>The resource table gives all groupsets as columns with groups as rows, and 1 DE per row.
        This means that all groupsets are joined in when e.g. creating a view to a pivot table.
        Resource tables have to be generated from the Maintenance-&gt;Data
        Administration-&gt;Resource Table window, and more information on this is available in a
        later chapter called Data Administration in DHIS2 or from the inline help text in that
        window. </p>

  <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e3623"></a>27.4.&nbsp;The time (period) dimension</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>The period dimension becomes an important factor when analysing data over time e.g. when looking at cumulative data, when creating quarterly or annual aggregated reports, or when doing analysis that combines data with different characteristics like monthly routine data, annual census/population data or six-monthly staff data.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3626"></a>27.4.1.&nbsp;Period Types</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>In DHIS2 the periods are organised according to a set of fixed period types: 1) Daily, 2) Weekly, 3) Monthly, 4) Quarterly, 5) Six-monthly, 6) Yearly, 7) Two-yearly, and 8) a special period type called Relative.

</p>
      <p>As a rule of thumb all organisation units should collect the same data using the same frequency or periodicity, so first of all the periods play an important role in standardising data collection across the country. A data entry form therefore needs to know its period type to make sure data is always collected according to the correct and same periodicity across the country. </p>
      <p>It is possible however to collect the same data elements using different period types by
        assigning the same data elements to multiple data sets with different period types, however
        then it becomes crucial to make sure no orgunit is collecting data using both data
        sets/period types as that would create overlap and duplication of data values. If set up
        correctly the aggregation service in DHIS2 (through datamart and report tables) will
        aggregate the data together, e.g. the monthly data from one part of the country with
        quarterly data from another part of the country into a national quarterly report. For
        simplicity and to avoid data duplication we strongly advice to use the same period type for
        all orgunits for the same data elements when possible. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3631"></a>27.4.2.&nbsp;Relative periods</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>When creating reports within the DHIS (report tables, standard reports, charts) it is
        possible to make use of the relative periods functionality. The simplest scenario is when
        you want to design a monthly report that can be reused every month without having to make
        changes to the report template to accommodate for the changes in period. The relative period
        called reporting_month allows for this, and the user can at the time of report generation
        through a report parameter select the month to use in the report. </p>
      <p>A slightly more advanced use case is  when you want to make a monthly summary report for immunisation and want to look at the data from the current (reporting) month together with a cumulative value for the year so far. The relative period called "So far this year" provides such a cumulative value relative to the reporting month selecting when running the report. Other relative periods are the last 3,6, 9 or 12 months periods which are cumulative values calculated back from the selected reporting month. If you want to create a report with data aggregated by quarters (the ones that have passed so far in the year) you can select "Individual quarters this year". Other relative periods are described under the reporting table section of the manual. Common for all the relative periods is that they are relative to a selected reporting month. Even quarterly or annual reports need to know their reporting month to derive the year, the quarter and so on. The reporting month then becomes one of the report parameters the users have to select when running a report based on relative periods.</p>

      <p>While data needs to be collected on a given frequency to standardise data collection and management, this does not put limitations on the period types that can be used in data analysis and reports. Just like data gets aggregated up the organisational hierarchy, data is also aggregated according to a period hierarchy, so you can create quarterly and annual reports based on data that is being collected on a Monthly basis. The defined period type for a data entry form (data set) defines the lowest level of period detail possible in a report.</p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e3667"></a>27.4.3.1.&nbsp;Sum and average aggregation along the period dimension</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>When aggregating data on the period dimension there are two options for how the calculation is done; 1) sum and 2) average, which is specified per data element in the DHIS2 through the use of the 'aggregation operator' attribute in the Add/Edit Data Elements window.

</p>
        <p>Most of the data collected on a routinely basis should be aggregated by summing up the months or weeks, e.g. you create a quarterly report on Measles immunisation by summing up the three monthly values for "Measles doses given". 

</p>
        <p>Other types of data that are more permanently valid over time like "Number of staff in the PHU" or an annual population estimate of "Population under 1 year" need to be aggregated differently. These values are static for all months as long as there are valid data. E.g. the estimated population under 1 calculated from the census data is the same for all months in a year, or the number of nurses working in a PHU is the same for every month in the 6 months period the number is reported for. 

</p>
        <p>This difference e.g. becomes important when calculating an annual value for the
          indicator morbidity service burden for a PHU. The monthly headcounts are summed up for the
          12 months to get the annual headcount while the number of staff for the PHU is calculated
          as the average of the two 6-monthly values reported through the 6-monthly staff report. So
          in this example the data element "OPD headcount" would have the aggregation
          operator "sum" and the data element "Number of staff" would have it
          set to "average". </p>
        <p>Another important feature of average data elements is the validity period concept.
          Average data values are standing values for any period type within the borders of the
          period they are registered for. E.g. an annual population estimate following the calendar
          year will have the same value for any period that falls within that year no matter what
          the period type. E.g. if the population under 1 for a Tugbebu CHP is 250 for the year of
          2009 that means that the value will be 250 for Jan-09, for Q3-09, for Week 12 of 2009 and
          for any period within 2009. This has implications for how e.g. coverage indicators are
          calculated as the full annual population will be used as denominator value even when doing
          monthly reports. If you want to look at an estimated annual coverage value for a given
          month then you will have the option of setting the indicator to "Annualised"
          which means that a monthly coverage value will be multiplied by 12, a quarterly value by 4
          etc. The annualised indicator feature can therefore be used to mimic the use of monthly
          population estimates. </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3676"></a>27.5.1.&nbsp;Data collection and storage</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>The datasets determine what raw data that is available in the system as they describe how data is collected. Through the data sets we define the building blocks of the data to be captured and stored in the DHIS. For each data dimension we decide what level of detail the data should be collected on; 1) the data element (e.g. diagnosis, vaccine, or any event taking place) and its categories (e.g. age and gender), 2) the period/frequency dimension, and 3) the orgunit dimension.  For any report or data analysis you can never retrieve more detailed data than what is defined in the datasets so the design of the datasets and their corresponding data entry forms (the data collection tools) dictate what kind of data analysis that will be possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3679"></a>27.5.2.&nbsp;Input != Output</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>It is important to understand that the data entry forms or datasets themselves are not linked to the data (values) and that  the meaning of data (the What) is only described by the data element (and its categories). This makes it perfectly safe to modify datasets and forms without altering the data (as long as the data elements stay the same). This loose coupling between forms and data makes DHIS  flexible when it comes to designing and changing new forms and in providing exactly the form the users want.   </p>
      <p>Another benefit of only linking data to data elements and not to forms is the flexibility of creating indicators and validation rules based on data elements, and also in providing any kind of output report (in pivot tables, charts, maps etc) that can combine data individually or across forms, e.g. to correlate data from different health programs. Due to this flexibility of enabling integration of data from various programs (forms) and sources (routine and semi permanent (population, staff, equipment)) a DHIS database is used as an integrated data repository for many or all parts of the aggregated data in a larger HIS. The figure below illustrates this flexibility.</p>

    <p>When doing data analysis in Excel pivot tables or any other OLAP based tool the dimensions become extremely powerful in providing many different views into the data. Each data element category or group set become a pivot field, and the options or groups become values within each of these fields. In fact categories and groupsets are treated exactly the same way in pivot tables, and so are orgunits, periods, and data elements. All these become dimensions to the data value that can be used to rearrange, pivot, filter, and to drill down into the data. Here we will show some examples of how the data dimensions are used in pivot tables.  </p>
    <p>Using the example of morbidity and mortality data, a pivot table can show how the  dimensions can be used to view data for different aggregation levels.

</p>
    <p>The completely aggregated number is viewed when none of the pivot fields are arranged in the table area, as column or row fields, but are listed above the table itself  as page field (filter).
</p>
    <p>
</p><div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_overview_1.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div><p>
</p>
    <p>Here we have selected to look at the Morbidity total. The various data elements on morbidity have been ordered into the main_de_groups Morbidity (we will get back to Mortality later). The fields above the table itself are all set to "All", meaning that the totals in the table will contain data from all Countries, Districts, Chiefdom, ou_type, year, months, the various categories as listed in the red fields, and all data elements in the Morbidity group.</p>
    <p>As we have seen, this is not a very useful representation, as Morbidity is organized into new cases, follow-ups, referrals, and then again in age groups. Also, we do not see the various diagnoses. The first step is to include the diagnoses field (which is a group set), which is done by dragging the "diagnosis" field down to be a row field, as shown in the figure below, and to add the group set called "morbiditymortality" in the column field to display new cases, follow-up, and referrals.</p>
    <p>
</p><div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_diagnoses.jpg" align="middle" width="60"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div><p>
</p>
    <p>Contrast this figure above to the one below.</p>
    <p>
</p><div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_dataelements.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div><p>
</p>
    <p>They both show the same data (some of the rows have been cut in the screenshot due to
      image size), albeit in a different way. </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>The "dataelement" field, used in the bottom figure, displays each diagnosis as three elements; one follow-up, one new, and one referrals. This is the way the data elements have been defined in DHIS, as this makes sense for aggregation. You would not like to aggregate follow-ups and new, thus these have not been made as categories, the whole point of is to ease aggregation and disaggregation.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>The "diagnosis" group set has instead been made to lump these three (follow-up, new, referrals) together, which can then be split with another group set, namely the one called "morbiditymortality". This allows us to organize the data as in the first of the two figures, where we have the single diagnosis per row, and the groups new, follow-up, referrals as rows.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>The idea of using group sets is that you can combine, in any set, different data elements. Thus, if we add the mortality data (by checking it from the drop-down menu of the main_de_groups field, and moving this field out of the table) we can see also the deaths, since the mortality data elements have been included as a "death" group in the "morbiditymortality" group set. The result is shown below.</p>
    <p>
</p><div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_diagnoses_all.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div><p>
</p>
    <p>The result is a much more user-friendly pivot table. Now, another figure shows the relationship between the group sets and elements (these are fake data values).</p>
    <p>

</p>
    <p>This small detail of the pivot table show how the actual data elements link to the group sets: </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
        <p>The four data elements, as defined in DHIS, are Measles death, Measles follow-up, Measles new, and Measles referrals</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>They all belong to the group set "diagnosis", where they have been lumped together in the group Measles</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>The group set "morbiditymortality" contains the groups New cases, Follow-up, Referrals, and Deaths.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Only the data element Measles deaths has data related to the group Deaths, thus this is where the data value (20) is shown, at the upper right corner. The same for Measles new; the value (224) is shown at the intersection of the data element Measles new and the group New cases (in the group set morbiditymortality)</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>All the intersections where the data element does not link with the groups in morbiditymortality are left blank. Thus in this case we would get a nice table if we excluded the dataelement from the table, and just had diagnosis and the group set morbiditymortality, as in the figure shown earlier</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>Now lets see how the data element categories can be used. In the data entry form for
      Morbidity the new cases and follow-ups use one age category, the referral data another,, and
      the mortality data a third age breakup, so these are available as three individual age group
      fields in the pivot tables called morbidity_age, referrals_age and mortality_age. It doesn't
      make sense to use these while looking at these data together (as in the examples above), but
      e.g. if we only want to look at the only the new cases we can put the MobidityMortalityGroups
      field back up as a page field and there select the New cases group as a filter. Then we can
      drag the Morbidity_age field down to the column area and we get the following view:</p>
    <div class="screenshot">
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/pivot_morb_age.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
    <p>The following table illustrates the benefits of reusing data element categories across
      datasets and categorycombinations. The VCCT, ART and PMTCT data are collected in three
      different datasets, the first two with both gender and age breakdown, and the PMTCT only age
      (gender is given). All three share the same age groups and therefore it is possible to view
      data elements from all these three datasets in the same table and use the age dimension. In
      the previous example with morbidity and mortality data this was not possible since new cases,
      referrals and deaths all have different age groups.</p>
    <div class="screenshot">

      </div><p>  </p>
    <p>In the table below PMTCT data has been removed from the table and the gender category added to the column area so that you can analyse the data for VCCT and ART by age and gender. An optional subtotal for gender has also been  added, as well as a grand total for all age and gender.</p>

    <p>Typically the design of a DHIS 2 dataset is based on some requirements from a paper form that is already in use. The logic of paper forms are not the same as the data element and data set model of DHIS, e.g. often a field in a tabular paper form is described both by column headings and text on each row, and sometimes also with some introductory table heading that provides more context. In the database this is captured in one atomic data element with no reference to a position in a visual table format, so it is important to make sure the data element with the optional data element categories capture the full meaning of each individual field in the paper form. </p>
    <p>Another important thing to have in mind while designing datasets is that the dataset and the corresponding data entry form (which is a dataset with layout) is a data collection tool and not  a report or analysis tool. There are other far more sophisticated tools for data output and reporting in DHIS than the data entry forms. Paper forms are often designed with both data collection and reporting in mind and therefore you might see things such as cumulative values (in addition to the monthly values), repetition of annual data (the same population data reported every month) or even indicator values such as coverage rates in the same form as the monthly raw data. When you store the raw data in DHIS every month and have all the processing power you need within the computerised tool there is no need (in fact it would be stupid and most likely cause inconsistency) to register manually calculated values such as the ones mentioned above. You only want to capture the raw data in your datasets/forms and leave the calculations to the computer, and presentation of such  values to the reporting tools in DHIS.</p>

      <p>As we have seen in the examples above the data element categories and their options are helpful in representing tabular data, when adding dimensions to a field in a paper form. We have also seen how the data element is the central dimension and that the data element categories are used to provide further details or disaggregation to the data element. As we will see in the example below there are often more than one way to represent a paper form in DHIS, and it can be difficult to know which dimension to represent with a data element name and which to represent as categories, or even as groups as we have seen above. Here are some general lessons learned from working with data element and category combinations:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
          <p>Design your dimensions with data use in mind, not data collection. This means that disaggregation of data values at collection time should be easily aggregated up along the various dimensions, as in adding up to a meaningful total.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Reuse dimensions as much as possible as it increased the ability to compare disaggregated data (e.g. age groups, fixed/outreach, gender). Not necessary to share all dimensions, it helps to share only one as well (much better than none).</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Disaggregation dimensions should add up to a total</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Different levels of dimensions; 1) disaggregation and 2) grouping. Disaggregation dimensions dictate how you collect and how detailed you store your data, so plan these carefully. The group dimension is more flexible and can be changed and added to even after data collection (think of it as tagging). </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Think integrated data repository and not forms or programs when designing the metadata model and revising forms. Use the same disaggregation for the same or similar data across forms. Reuse definitions so that the database can integrate even though the forms might be duplicating. </p>
        </li></ul></div>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>STEP BY STEP APPROACH TO DESIGNING DATASETS</strong></span></p>
      <p>1. Identify the different tables (or sub datasets) in the paper form that share the same dimensions</p>
      <p>2. For each table identify the dimensions that describe the data fields</p>
      <p>3. Identify the key dimension, the one that makes most sense to look at in isolation (when the others are collapsed, summed up). This is your data element dimension, the starting point and core of your multidimensional model (sub dataset). The data element dimension can be a merger of two or more dimensions if that makes more sense for data analysis. The key is to identify which total that makes most sense to look at alone when the other dimensions are collapsed.</p>
      <p>4. For all other/additional dimensions identify their options, and come up with explanatory names for dimensions and their options.</p>
      <p>5. Each of these additional dimensions will be a data element category and their options will be category options.</p>
      <p>6. Combine all categories for each sub dataset into one category combination and assign this to all the data elements in your table (or sub dataset if you like). </p>
      <p>7. When you are done with all the tables (sub datasets), create a new dataset and add all the data elements you have identified (in the whole paper form) to that dataset.</p>
      <p>8. Your dataset will then consist of a set of data elements that are linked to one or more category combinations. </p>
      <p>In order to better explain the approach and the possibilities we present an example paper form and will walk through it step by step and design data elements, categories, category options and category combinations.</p>

          <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="60%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/data_dimensions/PHUF3.jpg" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
        </div><p> </p>
      <p>This form has many tables and each of them potentially represent a data element category combination (from now on referred to as a catcombo). As such there is no restriction on a dataset to only have one set of dimensions or catcombo, it can have m For any and as we see above this is necessary as the dimensions are very different from table to table. We will walk through this table by table and discuss how to represent it in the DHIS.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>ANC table</strong></span>. This table in the top left corner is one the simpler ones in this form. It has two dimensions, the first column with the ANC activity or service (1st visit, IPT 2nd dose etc) and the 2nd and 3rd column which represent the place where the service was given with the two options fixed and outreach. Since the ANC service is the key phenomena to analyse here and often there is a need for looking at e.g. total of ANC 1st visits no matter where (fixed+outreach) it makes a lot of sense to use this dimension as the data element dimension. So all items on the first column from 1st ANC visit to 2nd IPT dose given by TBA are represented as individual data elements. The place dimension is represented as a data element category (from now on referred to as category) with the name "fixed/outreach" with the two data element category options (from now on catoptions) "fixed" and "outreach". There is no other dimension here so we add a new catcombo with the name "Fixed/Outreach" with one category "Fixed/Outreach". Strictly speaking there is another dimension in this table, and that is the at PHU or by TBA dimension which is repeated for the two doses of IPT, but since none of the other ANC services listed have this dimension it does not seem like a good idea to separate out two data elements from this table and give them another catcombo with both fixed/outreach and at PHU/by TBA. reusing the same catcombo for all the ANC services makes more sense since it will be easier to look at these together in reports etc. and also the fact that there is not much to loose by repeating the at PHU or by TBA information as part of the data element name when it is only for four data elements in a table of totally 11 data elements.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>DELIVERY table.</strong></span> This table is more tricky as it has a
        lot of information and you can see that not all the rows have the same columns (some columns
        are merged and a one field is grayed out/disabled.). If we start by looking at the first
        column "Deliveries assisted by" that seems to be one dimension, but only down to
        the "Untrained TBA" row, as the remaining three rows are not related to who
        assisted the delivery at all. Another dimension is the place of delivery, either In PHU or
        in Community as stated on the top column headings. These deliveries are further split into
        the outcome of the delivery, whether it is a live or still birth, which seems to be another
        dimension. So if we disregard the three bottom rows for a moment there seems to be 3
        dimensions here, 1) assisted by, 2) place of delivery, and 3) delivery outcome. The key
        decision to make is what to use as the data element, the main dimension, the total that you
        will most often use and want easily available in reports and data analysis. We ended up
        using the outcome dimension as total live births is a very commonly used value in many
        indicators (maternal mortality ratio, births attended by skilled health personnel etc.). In
        this case the Assisted By dimension could also have been used without any problem, but the
        added value of easily getting the total live births information was the decisive point for
        us. This means that from this table (or sub-table of row 1 to 6) there are only two data
        elements; "Live births" and "Still births". Then there are two more
        dimensions, the "PHU/Community" with its two options and a "Births attended
        by" with options ("MCH Aides", "SECHN", "Midwives",
        "CHO", "Trained TBA", "Untrained TBA"). These two categories
        make up the catcombo "Births" which is assigned to the two data elements
        "Live births" and "Still births". Considering the final three rows of
        the delivery table we can see that "Complicated Deliveries" does not have the
        assisted by dimension, but has the place and the outcome. "Low birth weight" also
        does not have the assisted by dimension and not the outcome either. The LLITN given after
        delivery does not have any additional dimension at all. Since not any of the three rows can
        share catcombo with any other row we decided to represent these fields as so called flat
        data elements, meaning data elements with no categories at all, and simply adding the
        additional information from the column headings to the data element name, and therefore
        ended up with the following data elements with the default (same as none) catcombo;
        "Complicated deliveries in PHU live birth", "Complicated deliveries in PHU
        still births", "Complicated deliveries in community live birth",
        "Complicated deliveries in community still births", "Low birth weight in
        PHU", "Low birth weight in community", and "LLITN given after
        delivery".</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>POST-NATAL CARE table</strong></span> This table is simple and we used the same approach as for the ANC table. 3 data elements listed in the first column and then link these to the catcombo called "fixed/outreach". Reusing the same category fixed/outreach for these data elements enables analysis on fixed/outreach together with ANC data and other data using the same category.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>TT table</strong></span> This is a bit more tricky. We decided to use
        "TT1", "TT2" ... "TT5" as data elements which makes it easy to
        get the total of each one of these. There is fixed/outreach dimension here, but there is
        also the In school place that is only applied to the Non-Pregnant, or more correctly to any
        of the two as the school immunisation is done whether the girls are pregnant or not. We
        consulted the program people behind the form and found out that it would be OK to register
        all school TT immunisations as non-pregnant, which simplifies the model a bit since we can
        reuse the "TT1" to "TT5" data elements. So we ended up with a new
        category called "TT place" with the three options (Fixed, Outreach, In School),
        and another category called "Pregnant/Non-pregnant" with two options. The new
        catcombo "TT" is then a combination of these two and applied to the 5 TT data
        elements. Since we agreed to put all In Schools immunisations under Non-pregnant in means
        that the combination of options (Pregnant+In School) will never be used in any data entry
        form, and hence become a possible optioncombo, which is OK. As long as the form is custom
        designed then you can choose which combinations of options to use or not, and therefore it
        is not a problem to have such passive or unused catoptions. Having school as one option in
        the TT place category simplifies the model and therefore we thought it was worth it. The
        alternative would be to create 5 more data elements for "TT1 in school" ...
        "TT5 in school", but then it would be a bit confusing to add these together with
        the "TT1" ..."TT5" plus TT catcombo. Having school as a place in the TT
        place category makes it a lot easier to get the total of TT1.. TT5 vaccines given, which are
        the most important numbers and most often used values for data analysis.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Complications of early and late pregnancy and labour
          tables</strong></span> We treat these two tables as one, and will explain why. These two tables
        are a bit confusing and not the best design. The major data coming out of these tables are
        the pregnancy complications and the maternal deaths. These are the major things for data
        analysis. And then there is further detail on the cause of the complication or death (the
        first column in both tables), as well as a place of death (in PHU or community), and a
        outcome of the complication (when its not a death) that can be either Managed at PHU or
        Referred. We decided to create two data elements for these two tables; "Pregnancy
        complications", and "Maternal Deaths", and two category combinations, one for
        each of the data elements. For the Pregnancy Complications data element there are two
        additional dimensions, the cause of the complication (the combined list of the first column
        in the two tables) and the outcome (managed at PHU or Referred), so these are the categories
        and options that make up that category combination. For the "Maternal deaths" data
        element the same category with the different causes are used and then another category for
        the place of death (in PHU or In community). This way the two data elements can share one
        category and it will be easy to derive the total number of pregnancy complications and
        maternal deaths. While the list of complications on the paper form is divided into two
        (early and late/labour) you can see that e.g. the malaria in 2nd and 3rd trimester are
        listed under early, but in fact are for a later phase of the pregnancy. There is no clear
        divide between early and late complications in the form, and therefore we gave up trying to
        make this distinction in the database. </p>
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Family Planning Services table</strong></span> This table has 2 dimensions, the family planning method (contraceptive) and whether the client is new or continuing. We ended up with one data element only "Family planning clients" and then added two categories "FP method" with all the contraceptives as options, and another category "FP client type" with new or continuing as options. This way it will be easy to get the total number of family planning clients which is the major value to look at in data analysis, and from there you can easily get the details on method or how many new clients there are.</p>
