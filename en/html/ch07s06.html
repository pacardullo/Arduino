    <p>Software carries the instructions that tell a computer how to
        operate. The human authored and human readable form of those
        instructions is called source code. Before the computer can actually
        execute the instructions, the source code must be translated into a
        machine readable (binary) format, called the object code. All
        distributed software includes the object code, but <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> makes the
        source code available as well.</p>
    <p>Proprietary software owners license their copyrighted object
        code to a user, which allows the user to run the program. <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr>
        programs, on the other hand, license both the object and the source
        code, permitting the user to run, modify and possibly redistribute the
        programs. With access to the source code, the users have the freedom
        to run the program for any purpose, redistribute, probe, adapt, learn
        from, customise the software to suit their needs, and release
        improvements to the public for the good of the community. Hence, some
        <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> is also known as free software, where &#8220;free&#8221; refers, first and
        foremost, to the above freedoms rather than in the monetary sense of
        the word.</p>
    <p>Within the public health sector, <abbr class="abbrev">FOSS</abbr> can potentially have a
        range of benefits, including:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Lower costs as it does not involve paying for prohibitive
            license costs.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Given the information needs for the health sector are
            constantly changing and evolving, there is a need for the user to
            have the freedom to make the changes as per the user requirements.
            This is often limited in proprietary systems.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Access to source code to enable integration and interoperability. In the health sector interoperability between different software applications is becoming increasingly important, meaning enabling two or more systems to communicate metadata and data.    This work is a lot easier, and sometimes dependent on the source code being available to the developers that create the integration. This availability is often not possible
            in the case of proprietary software. And when it is, it comes at a
            high cost and contractual obligations.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>FOSS applications like DHIS 2 typically are supported by a
            global network of developers, and thus have access to cutting edge
            research and development knowledge.</p>
