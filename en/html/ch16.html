    <p>All data entry in DHIS2 is organised through the use of data sets. You can add and edit
      data sets in Maintenance-&gt;Data sets. A data set is a collection of data elements grouped
      together for data collection and data export between instances of DHIS2 (e.g. from a district
      office local installation to a national server). </p>
    <p>A data set has a data collection frequency which can be set through the period type
      property. The frequency can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, six-monthly, or yearly.
      Which data elements to include in the data set and the frequency are set in the Add/Edit Data
      set window. In order to use a data set to collect data for a specific orgunit you must assign
      the orgunit to the data set, and this mechanism controls which org units that can use which
      data sets. </p>
    <p>Data sets also are assigned to specific organisation units which will be allowed to enter
      data for all data elements in that data set. You can assign org units to a data set in the
      Data set management by clicking on the blue folder icon, the first icon under Operations, next
      to the data set you would like to modify. Alternatively you can manage orgunit assignments for
      all data sets together in the Data set Assignment Editor (available in the right-side menu). </p>
    <p>A data set has several properties that must be entered when creating a new one. Name,
      short name, code and description should be used to identify and describe the data set. The
      other properties deserve an explanation:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Expiry days: Controls for how long it should be possible to enter data in data entry
          for this data set. Expiry days refer to the number of days after the end date of the
          selected data entry period where the data entry form should be open for entry. After the
          number of days has expired, the data set will be locked for further entry. You can set
          manual exceptions to this using the lock exception functionality in data administration
          module.</p>
        <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="resources/images/admon/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
          <p>If the number of expiry days is set to zero, this will  allow data entry into all possible historical time periods. </p>
        </td></tr></table></div>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Complete notification recipients: Sets which users should receive a message with a
          notification about this data set being marked as complete in data entry. In this list you
          can select a user group, and all members in this group will receive a notification. The
          message will be delivered through the DHIS messaging system.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Approve data: Define whether data for this data set should be Approved. (See the Data
          approval chapter.)</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Skip aggregation: Define whether data for this data set should be skipped during data
          mart generation. You should leave this on no, which is the default behavior, in most
          situations. Can be useful if you have limited server resources and are setting up new
          experimental data sets.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Allow future periods: Defines whether it should be possible to enter data for future
          periods for this data set in data entry. The default behavior is to allow data entry only
          for periods which have passed, i.e. the end date is after today's date. If set to yes
          you can enter data for future periods, which is useful e.g. for population, target and
          planning data.'</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>All fields for data elements required: Defines whether it is mandatory to fill all
          values for a data element in data entry if one or more values have been filled. This means
          that if the user enters one data value for a data element in an entry field (i.e. for a
          category option combination), then she must enter data for all fields belonging to that
          data element (i.e. all category option combinations).</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Complete allowed only if validation passes: Controls whether it should be possible to
          mark a data entry form as complete only if the validation of that form is successful.
          Default behavior is yes. If set to no, then a user cannot mark the form complete if
          validation fails.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Skip Offline: Controls whether this data entry form should be downloaded and saved in
          the user's web browser. Normally you should leave this on no, which is the default
          behavior. If you have forms which are rarely used and are very big you can consider
          setting it to yes to speed up initial loading of the data entry module.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>Your data set will then be ready to be used in Services-&gt;Data Entry for the org units
      that you have assigned and for periods according to your selected frequency (period

      <p>Before reading this section it is recommended to familiarize oneself with the sections
        on categories in the data element chapter. Whereas data element categories can be used for
        capturing disaggregations of data elements, data set categories are used to capture
        information which is common to an entire form.</p>
      <p>To set up categories for data set, start by creating category options, categories and
        category combinations like described in the data element chapter. Make sure that you set the
        type of categories and category combinations to "Attribute". To assign a category
        combination to a data set, you can select it while creating or updating the data set from
        the "Combination of categories" drop-down box.</p>
      <p>When a data set is linked to a category combination, those categories will be displayed
        as drop-down boxes in the data entry module. Data captured in the form will then be linked
        to the selected category options from those drop-down boxes.</p>
      <p>An scenario for when data set categories are useful is when you need to capture a data
        entry form for a implementer partner organisation and a project. In that case, start by
        creating category options and categories for all partner organisations and projects, before
        linking these in a new category combination. Then, link the category combination to the data
        set (form) for which you need to capture this information. When opening this data set in
        data entry module, the partner organisation and project categories will automatically be
        rendered as drop-down boxes, allowing you to select a specific implementing partner
        organisation and project before continuing to do data entry.</p>
