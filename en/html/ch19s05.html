    <p>As well as checking for correct data, you can use a validation rules  to find unexpected data  values when compared with data from previous time periods. This kind of validation rules are called <span class="italic">surveillance</span> rules.</p>
    <p>To add a surveillance rule, follow the steps above for validation rules, choosing a <span class="italic">
        <span class="italic">rule type</span>
      </span> of <span class="italic">Surveillance</span>. This adds the following validation rule options:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Choose an <span class="italic">Organisation unit level</span> for this surveillance rule. If the data you wish to monitor is not entered at this level, it will be aggregated from lower level organisation units  in the organisation unit hierarchy.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter a <span class="italic">Sequential sample count</span>. This is the number of time periods immediately preceding against which you wish to compare the data. For example, if the  period type is <span class="italic">Weekly</span> and this count is 2, the current data will be compared with past  data averaged over each of the 2 previous weeks.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter an <span class="italic">Annual sample count</span>. This is the number of preceding years over which you will compare the data, from  periods at the same time of preceding years. For example if the period type is Weekly and the count is 3, data for a week starting on the first of September will be compared with data averaged over the week containing September 1 in each of the past 3 years.</p>
        <p>The sequential sample count <span class="italic">or</span> annual sample count must be at least 1.</p>
        <p>You may use the sequential and annual sample counts together. For example, say the period type is <span class="italic">Weekly</span>, the sequential count is 2, and the annual count is 3. The data will be compared with the average of the following time periods: the 2 weeks immediately preceding, and for each of the previous 3 years the data at the same time of year, plus the preceding 2 weeks, plus the following 2 weeks. This makes a total of  17 past periods: 2 immediate past periods plus 5 periods for each of the 3 preceding years. Be aware that when you have many past periods like this, evaluating the surveillance rule may take significant time and system resources.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter a number of <span class="italic">High outliers</span> of past data that you wish to exclude from comparison. This is useful if some past periods may have had unusually high data values, and you wish to compare against the average of all but the highest past period values. This gives the number of highest past period values to exclude before the past period values are averaged and compared with the current value.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Enter a number of <span class="italic">Low outliers</span> of past data that you wish to exclude from comparison. This is like High outliers except that it gives the number of lowest past period values to exclude before the past period values are averaged and compared with the current value.</p>
        <p>You may use the high and low outliers in combination, but the sum of high outliers and low outliers must be less than the total number of past samples as determined by the sequential and annual sample counts. In the example above where there are 17 past periods, the sum of high and low outliers must be 16 or less.</p>
        <p>If data is not found for all the desired past periods, the high and low outliers will be reduced in proportion to the number of periods for which data is found. For example, say we are looking for 17 past periods with high outliers set to 4 and low outliers set to 2. If data is found for only 9 of these past periods, only 2 high outliers will be discarded, and only 1 low outlier will be discarded.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>When a surveillance rule is evaluated, the <span class="italic">left side</span> of the equation is evaluated for the current period, and the <span class="italic">right side</span> is evaluated for each of the past periods. The right side  values for past periods are   averaged, and the average is  compared to the left side value according to the operator. Any high or low outliers are removed before the right-side average is taken.</p>
    <p>A surveillance rule may contain data elements for periods that are longer than the period given for the rule. This is useful, for example, if you want to divide a data element value by the population count, and the population count is entered annually. The data for the longer period type (e.g. population count) must be entered for a period that overlaps with the start of the period being evaluated. For example, if the period being evaluated is the week starting January 6, 2014, the yearly population count must be entered for the year containing January 6 2014. If the data element is from a longer period type than the rule period type, it must have an aggregation operator of average, not sum. In other words, only data elements that don't sum through time (like population count) can be used from longer periods than the rule period.</p>
    <p>For surveillance rules, the <span class="italic">skip for missing</span> option is given an additional meaning when data is being collected and aggregated from lower levels of the organisation unit hierarchy. When this option is selected and the data is present for some descendants at a lower level, but not all descendants at that level, the rule is skipped.</p>
