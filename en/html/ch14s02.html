      <p>This is where you can create organisation units (from now on referred to as orgunits) and build up the orgunit hierarchy. Orgunits are added one by one as either root unit or a child of a selected unit. The left side menu represents the current organisational hierarchy and if you select a unit there you will see its children listed in the main list of orgunits in the middle of the screen. When an orgunit is selected in the left side menu you can also add new child units to it. To locate an orgunit in the hierarchy you can either navigate through the tree by expanding the branches (click on the + symbol), or search for it by opening the search field (click the green symbol above the root of the hierarchy). In search you can either search for the orgunit name or its code, both will only show exact matches (case-insensitive). To add a new orgunit first select its parent and then click on the Add new button in the top right corner of the list of orgunits. To add a new root orgunit make sure no orgunit is selected in the menu and click on "Add new". The details of adding a new orgunit are explained in <a class="xref" href="ch14s02.html#editOrganisationalUnits">the section called &#8220;Editing organisation units&#8221;</a>. </p>

        <p>To edit the properties of an existing orgunit first select its parent (if any) in the left side menu, then locate the orgunit in the listed orgunits, and  click on  the  name of the orgunit that you want to modify. A context menu will appear, and you should select "Edit". Refer to the screen-shot below to see how it works. </p>

            <p>Opening date: Used to control which orgunits that where existing  at a point in time, e.g. when analysing historical data. This attribute is required. The default date for opening of organisation units is 1900-01-01, but can be set to any date (even dates which occur in the future).</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Registers data: This property is used to identify which orgunits that can register data or not. Sometimes administrative orgunits at higher levels in the hierarchy are not supposed to register any data. This can help control the data entry process as only orgunits with this property set to Yes will be available for data entry.  </p>
          </li><li class="listitem">

            <p>Coordinates: This field is used to create the maps in the GIS module. Paste in the coordinates of the orgunit in this field, either a polygon (for orgunits that represent an administrative boundary) or a point (for health facilities). Without this information the GIS module will not work. It might be more efficient to import these coordinates later as a batch job for all orgunits using the import module. See the GIS chapter for more details.</p>

      <p>Group sets can be understood as a flexible tool to add more categorisation to orgunits. Any number of group sets can be added, but as a default start all databases will have the two group sets "Type" and "Ownership". Using these  group sets will simplify how reporting is done, and facilitate analysis through the use of tools such as Excel PivotTables.</p>
      <p>While a group set like "Type" describes a measure dimension, the actual
        categories are represented by the groups, and the categorisation of an orgunit through the
        orgunit's group memberships. This can be understood as a parallel hierarchy of orgunits
        with the group set as the root ("Type"), the groups at level 2 (e.g.
        "Clinic", "Hospital", "Dispensary"), and the actual orgunits
        at level 3. The group set can as such provide additional information and dimensionality to
        the data analysis as data is easily filtered, organised, or aggregated by groups within a
        group set. </p>
      <p>For this aggregation to work without any duplication in the data some rules are necessary. A group set is always exclusive, which means that an orgunit cannot be member of more than one group in a group set. Therefore, when creating a new organisational unit, you will only be allowed to select a single organisational group membership for each group set. Furthermore it is possible to define whether a group set is compulsory or not, which will affect the completeness of the data when analysing data using group sets. Compulsory means that ALL orgunits must be member of a group in that group set. </p>
      <p>We recommend that you approach the orgunit grouping in the following sequence (and one group set at a time):</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
          <p>Define a new group set, such as "Location". </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Add new  groups  (such as "Urban", "Rural" and "Peri-urban"). Once all groups have been defined, return to the organisational unit group set and assign each of the desired groups to the group set.</p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>Go back to each group, one by one, go to edit mode and assign the orgunits that should be member of the group. Should you follow this route, you can place multiple organisation units at a time in a group. However, you must be careful not to place the same organisational units in two groups which itself is a member of an organisation unit group set. This will result in a data integrity violation. If you have organisation unit groups which are not exclusive, they should not be members of a group. </p>
        </li><li class="listitem">
          <p>A better way to ensure that you do not mistakenly assign an organisation unit to
            multiple members of a group set is you can use the edit feature of each organisational
            unit to assign memberships to each group set. You will only be able to assign a single
            organisation unit at a time however.</p>
        </li></ol></div>
      <p>It is important to keep in mind when using the "Organisational unit group" set function, that unless great care is taken, organisational units can be assigned to multiple groups of a group set. This can be checked through the "Data Integrity" module, which will report which organisational units are not members of a compulsory organisational unit group set, and which organisational units have been assigned to more than one member of a group set. </p>

        <p>Click on the name of the organisation unit group set you wish to modify, followed by "Edit" from the context menu which will appear.  The following properties can be defined in the Edit (or Create new) window:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
            <p>Name: Provide a precise name for the group set.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Description: Describe the phenomena the group set is measuring/capturing.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Compulsory: Indicate whether ALL orgunits need to be member of a group in this group set or not.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Available groups/Selected groups: Here you assign groups to your group set by using the arrow buttons to move  highlighted groups between the two lists (/selected). If no groups appear in the  list then you must go to orgunit groups and create new groups there first. Note that assigning groups that will violate the exclusive rule on group sets is not possible, e.g. adding a group that already has assigned an orgunit that again is already member of a group that has already  been selected by this group set, will not be possible since one orgunit will end up with two group memberships in the same group set. To avoid such situations we recommend first adding groups to group sets, and then orgunits to groups.</p>

      <p>Here you can move orgunits around in the hierarchy by changing the parent of a selected orgunit. This process is done in three steps:</p>
      <p>1. Select the orgunit you want to move (in the hierarchy in the left side menu) and click "Confirm" under the "Select an organisation unit to move" label.</p>
      <p>2. Select the new parent orgunit (again by using the hierarchy in the left side menu). If no parent is selected then the orgunit will be moved up to root level (top of the hierarchy). Click on the "Confirm" button under the "Select the new parent organisation unit for the one to move" label.</p>
      <p>3. Click on the "Move" button to apply your changes to the hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Your changes will be immediately reflected in the left side menu hierarchy. At any time
        in the process (before hitting the Move button) you can click on the "Reset"
        button to deselect orgunit to move and the new parent.</p>
