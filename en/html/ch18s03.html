    <p>The sharing functionality is useful in several scenarios. One use-case is setting up a
      DHIS instance for a global organisation with operations in multiple countries. Typically the
      organisation has a set of global data sets, indicators and reports which should apply to all
      countries, while all countries will have the need for country-specific data sets, indicators
      and reports. In this scenario the following approach could work: </p>
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
        <p>Set up one user group for global personnel.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Set up a user group for personnel in each country.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Create global data sets and reports, make them viewable for everyone and editable for
          the global user group only.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p>Create country-specific data sets and reports, make them viewable and editable for the
          country user group and the global user group only.</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    <p>This way, the global indicators and reports could be viewed and analysed by everyone, but
      maintained by the global user group only. The country-specific data sets, indicators and
      reports could be viewed and maintained by the country and global personnel, without being
      visible or impacting the system for other countries in the organisation.</p>
    <p>A similar approach could work for a scenario with a donor, multiple funding agencies and
      implementing partners in a country, where user groups could be set up for each of those
      entities. That way each implementing partner could create and share their reports within their
      organisation without affecting or allowing access to others. Reports could also be shared with
      supervisors and funding agencies at the end of reporting periods.</p>
    <p>Another use-case is a country department of health with multiple health programs.
      Typically there is a need for having general reports and charts for the department while
      allowing the health programs to develop specific reports and charts for internal use. This can
      be achieved by creating user groups for each health program. Later, when developing reports
      and charts, these can be made viewable and editable to the program user group only. This way
      the reports will not be visible to other programs and users. This is beneficial because the
      reports are kept internal to the program and because the visible list of reports of other
      users are kept shorter and more relevant.</p>
