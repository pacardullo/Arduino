  <p>DHIS2 allows for multiple users to access the system simultaneously, each with a defined set of permissions. These permissions can be finely tuned so that certain users can only enter data, while others may generate reports. Multiple user roles can be created, each with their own set of permissions, and then assigned to users which grant them certain privileges within the system. This chapter describes how to manage users and user roles.</p>
  <div class="section" title="Creating new users and roles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="creating_new_users"></a>Creating new users and roles</h2></div></div></div>
    
    <p>This section will describe how to add new users and manage existing users to the DHIS2 application. You can create as many user names as you need. Each user can be assigned certain privileges, and can be assigned to certain organisation units for which they will be enabled to enter data on behalf of. To access the user module, choose <span class="italic">Users</span> from the Apps menu and then click "User" from the menu items on the left-hand pane.</p>
    <div class="section" title="User maintenance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="user_maintenance"></a>User maintenance</h3></div></div></div>

      </div>
      <p>User names already registered will appear as a list as seen in the screen shot below.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/search_user_by_name.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>You can search for specific user names in the user list by
      entering the name in the <span class="italic">Filter by name</span> field as shown
      above.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" title="User role management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="user_user_roles"></a>User role management</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>As part of creating a user name you are required to define the user
      role. Do so by clicking on <span class="italic">User Role</span> on the left side of
      the displayed screen. This will lead you to the User role management page where you can
      click on <span class="guibutton">Add new</span> to create a new role.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/add_user_role.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>The following screen will open and here in the first text box you
      need to give a <span class="italic">Name</span> of the Role such as Super User,      Admin User, etc. The
      second text box called <span class="italic">Description</span> gives more information about the
      type of User Role that is being created for e.g. State Admin User,
      District Data Entry.</p>
      <div class="screenshot">
        
        <div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="80%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/images/dhis2UserManual/role_maintenance_page.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div>
      </div>
      <p>Next you will specify the particular data set(s) that are to be
      made available to the particular role. You will also need to specify the
      type of <span class="italic">Authority</span> to be given to the particular user. For each of the
      three options namely Datasets, Reports and Authorities user can select
      multiple options from the scroll down menu provided against each field.
      A user can choose multiple options either by moving them
      one-by-one.</p>
      <p>In order for particular users to be able to enter data, you must
      add them to both a dataset as well as an organisational unit level. You
      can also select multiple datasets individually by pressing the Ctrl key
      on the keyboard and clicking on individual datasets.</p>
      <p>Finally when you have entered the required fields click on
      <span class="guibutton">Save</span> which is located on the lower part of the
      displayed screen. The desired user role and related authorisation will
      be saved to the database, and can then be assigned to a particular
      user.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" title="User management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="user_management"></a>User management</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>Under particular user role there can be more than one user. To manage
      users, click on <span class="italic">User</span> on the left side of the screen.
      This will lead you to the <span class="italic">User management</span> page.</p>
      <p>To add a new user, follow these steps:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">

              <p>If you choose this action, then enter the following information: username, password, surname, first name, E-mail,
              OpenID account (if any) and mobile phone number (if any).</p>
              <p>After you finish adding the user, the account will be ready for them to use with the username and password

              <p>If you choose this action, then enter the email address to which the invitation should be sent.
              If you want to, you may also enter the user name that the account will have. If you leave the username
              empty, then the user may choose their own username when they respond to the invitation (as long as it
              is not taken already for another user.)</p>
              <p>After you finish adding the new user, two emails will be sent to the address you provided. One contains
              a unique web link by which the user can return to the system and activate their account by entering the rest of their
              user information. The other email contains a unique code that they must enter into the system in order to
              complete the registration, after following the link in the first email. The user must finish setting up the account within three months, or the invitation
              becomes invalid.</p>

            as well as all of the facilities contained within the district. The data approval organisation

            below it in the organisation unit hierarchy. Note that data view organisation units are
            optional. If you do not specify any, the user will have access to the full organisation

          <p>In several places in the analysis modules one can select "user organisation unit"

          (category option groups.) If you want to insure that the user does not see totals in analytics that include values
          from other groups, assign <span class="italic">Implementing Partner</span> to this user. This insures that any data visible to the user

      <p>DHIS 2 supports the OpenID standard, which allows third party login using a OpenID
        provider, please see <a class="ulink" href="http://openid.net" target="_top">http://openid.net</a> for more
        information. To create a custom OpenID URL for a username you can visit this URL and log in
        with your OpenID provider: <a class="ulink" href="http://openid-provider.appspot.com" target="_top">http://openid-provider.appspot.com</a>.</p>
      <p>To enable support for this in DHIS 2, two steps must be done:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Set your OpenID provider</strong></span>: This can be done inside

              the label to display on the login page to login with this provider (defaults to Login
              with OpenID).</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
