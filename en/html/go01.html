As an example, all the academic departments in a particular school would contribute to the total value for the particular school in question. Different aggregation operators are supported within DHIS2, such as SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT.</p></dd><dt>Aggregate data</dt><dd><p>In the context of DHIS2, aggregate data refers to either data elements or indicators that have been derived from other hierarchical data sources. For instance, aggregate departmental data would result from the aggregate totals of all students that have attended courses that department for a particular training program. Aggregate district data would result from the aggregate totals of all academic departments in that particular training program. </p></dd><dt>Application programming interface</dt><dd><p>An application programming interface is a specification of how different software components should interact with each other. The DHIS2 API (or WebAPI) can be used to interface DHIS2 with other software, to build reports or custom data entry forms. </p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv" title="B"><h3 class="title">B</h3><dl><dt>Bimonthly</dt><dd><p>Refers to a two-month period, such as January 1st to February 28th.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv" title="C"><h3 class="title">C</h3><dl><dt>Category</dt><dd><p>Categories are groups of category options. They are used in combinations to disaggregate data elements. Categories are typically a single type of concept, such as "Age" , "Gender","Race","Geographic Location", "Employment status", "Socio-economic status". </p></dd><dt>Category combinations</dt><dd><p>Category combinations are used to disaggregate data elements. As an example, the data element "Number of confirmed cases of malaria" could be disaggregated subdivided into categories: "Age" and "Gender". In turn each of these categories, would consist of several category options, such as "Male" and "Female" for the gender category, &#8220;black", &#8220;white"and &#8220;mixed race"for race category; Urban" and &#8220;rural" for geographical location category;" income or expenditure quintiles for socio-economic status category; &#8220;Diploma", &#8220;Bachelors", &#8220;Masters", &#8220;PhD"for level of study category; &#8220;lecturer", &#8220;senior lecturer", associate professor", &#8220;professor"for academic rank category; &#8220;permanent"and &#8220;temporary" for employment status category; &#8220;medicine", &#8220;nursing", &#8220;pharmacy", &#8220;"nutrition", e.t.c. for academic program category.Category combinations may consist of one or several categories. </p></dd><dt>Category combination options</dt><dd><p>Category combination options are dynamically composed of all of the different combinations of category options which compose a category combination. As an example, two categories "Gender" and "Academic Rank", might have options such as "Male"/"Female" and "Professor"/"Associate Professor"/"Senior Lecturer"/"Lecturer". The category combination options would then consist of:</p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td>(Male/Professor)</td></tr><tr><td>(Male/Associate Professor)</td></tr><tr><td>(Male/Senior Lecturer)</td></tr><tr><td>(Male/Lecturer)</td></tr><tr><td>(Female/Professor)</td></tr><tr><td>(Female/Associate Professor)</td></tr><tr><td>(Female/Senior Lecturer)</td></tr><tr><td>(Female/Lecturer)</td></tr></table></dd><dt>Category option</dt><dd><p>Category options are atomic elements that are grouped into categories.</p></dd><dt>Comma separated values</dt><dd><p>Comma separated values are series of tabular data stored in a plain-text format. They are commonly used with DHIS2 to export and import data values. </p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv" title="D"><h3 class="title">D</h3><dl><dt>Data dictionary</dt><dd><p>A collection of data elements and indicators, which can be exchanged with other DHIS systems. Typically used to define a set of data elements and indicators when setting up the DHIS system. </p></dd><dt>Data exchange format</dt><dd><p>In the context of DHIS2, the "data exchange format" refers to a XML schema that enables the transportation of data and metadata between disconnected DHIS instances, as well as between different applications that support the DXF schema. </p></dd><dt>Datamart</dt><dd><p>A set of database tables in DHIS2 that contains processed data elements and indicator values that is generated based on aggregation rules and calculated data element and indicator formular. Datamart tables are used for analysis  and report production. Typically, users should not work directly with unaggregated data values, but rather with values that have resulted from a datamart export for analysis. </p></dd><dt>Data element</dt><dd><p>A data element is the fundamental building block of DHIS2. It is an atomic unit of data with well-defined meaning. Essentially it is a data value that has been actually observed or recorded which is further characterized by a number of dimensions. Examples are: applications (head counts) per educational program in the institution; enrollment (head counts) per educational program in the institution; course repeat rate; year repeat rate; attrition rate; retention rate; success rate; graduation rate; throughput rate; certification ratehead count of academic staff; headcount of administrative staff; academic staff qualification; institutional unit income; institutional unit expenditure; cost of training a graduate; source of financial support to students. Data elements are always linked to a period as well as an organizational unit. They optionally may be linked to other dimensions.</p></dd><dt>Data element group</dt><dd><p>Data element groups are used to categorize multiple data elements according to a common theme, such as .Student selection, admission and numbers; Student progression and achievement; Student development support and guidance; Teaching and Learning; Research; Human Resources; Budgeting and fiscal management; Alumni tracking. Typically, they are used during reporting and analysis to allow related data elements to be analyzed together.</p></dd><dt>Data element group sets</dt><dd><p>Data element groups are used to categorize multiple data element groups into a common theme. </p></dd><dt>Dimension</dt><dd><p>A dimension is used to categorize data elements during analysis. Dimensions provide a mechanism to group and filter data based on common characteristics. Typically, related data elements may be aggregated or filtered during analysis with the use of dimensions. Dimensions may be a member of a hierarchy. For instance the "Period" dimension may be broken down into "Day-&gt;Month-&gt;Quarter-&gt;Year". </p></dd><dt>DXF</dt><dd><p>See  Data exchange format.</p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv" title="E"><h3 class="title">E</h3><dl><dt>Education Management Information System (EMIS)</dt><dd><p>Typically, an electronic database system that is used to record aggregated data on academic performance, financial performance, infrastructure,  human resource data and other information used to evaluate the performance of higher educational institutions.  Some of the commonly used educational data management systems include the enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, the learning management systems (LMS), and the Integrated Tertiary Software (ITS). UNESCO has developed an open-source system called Open EMIS that can be easily modified and adapted to the needs of secondary and tertiary educational institutions (https://www.openemis.org/products/school)</p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv" title="I"><h3 class="title">I</h3><dl><dt>Indicator</dt><dd><p>The divisor of an indicator.

The organisational unit dimension specifies essentially "where" a particular data value occurs.</p></dd><dt>Organisational unit level</dt><dd><p>Refers to a level within an organizational hierarchy. Typically, higher educational institutions are administered at different levels, such as 1)college 2) Faculty 3) School 4) Academic Department. In the context of DHIS2,academic departments typically are the lowest orgunit level. Data is aggregated upwards from the lowest orgunit level to the highest. </p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv" title="P"><h3 class="title">P</h3><dl><dt>Period</dt><dd><p>A period is a specific time interval which consists of a start date and end date.
