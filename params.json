{"name":"Dean's Dashboard GitHub Test","tagline":"","body":"## About the Dean’s Dashboard\r\n\r\nThe Dean’s Dashboard turns data into information, empowering school leaders to translate complicated data and statistical analysis into simple yet meaningful visual representations, such as charts, graphs, pivot tables, and maps. The dashboard allows school leaders to systematically define strategic, indicator-based goals for their educational programs and routinely monitor progress toward achieving them. Visualization objects created and monitored on the dashboard can be easily saved, shared, and integrated into presentations, brochures, school websites, and other key management materials. A school’s management team can download and customize the demonstration dashboard linked to this page, or build their own dashboard using the most recent version of the powerful DHIS2 software. The step-by-step user’s manual and DHIS2 expert community can provide the guidance and support needed to install, customize, and maximize the use of the dashboard for years of data-driven decision making.\r\n\r\n[Download Information Sheet] (http://www.capacityplus.org/files/resources/deans-dashboard-strengthening-school-management.pdf)  \r\n[Download Pilot School Case Studies] (http://www.capacityplus.org/files/resources/deans-dashboard-strengthening-school-management.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n## Try It Now\r\n![User Manual](http://www-test.capacityplus.org/files/images/learnmore2_0.png)\r\n[Step-by-Step Manual](http://dhis2.github.io/DeansDashboardDocs/en/html/deans_dashboard_implementation_guide.html)\r\n\r\n## Foundational Software and User Support\r\n![Download DHIS2](http://www-test.capacityplus.org/files/images/download_0.png)\r\n[Download DHIS2](http://stable.dhis2.org/)\r\n\r\n![User Manual](http://www-test.capacityplus.org/files/images/usersupport_0.png)\r\nStep-by-Step Manual","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
